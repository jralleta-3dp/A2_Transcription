Christina cook observing site 3 Mari in Guinea and swirls This site is Fairly difficult to identify because it is right on the Terminator.

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:30,025
Of course that gives us some good observing options and in order to make sure that I have it I

3
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:40,382
I am going to locate it relative to Apollo and Aitken.

4
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:47,467
It is kind of like on the 90 degree between Apollo and Aitken if you were to draw a square encompassing them.

5
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:54,833
It is direct due west of Apollo and due south of Aitken, which I can identify on here.

6
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:27,863
So the crater shape is kind of appears almost hard to tell but I would I would describe it as a little bit trapezoidal but also kind of lily paddish with areas inside the crater that have almost little walls or terrain as well defining it.

7
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:46,220
The colors are difficult to discern, but I don't make out a lot of the swirling that is more easy to see when it is lit.

8
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:59,003
In fact, from this view, it's pretty difficult to see any brighter patterns.

9
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:05,170
I'm seeing a lot of dark and shadow.

10
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:22,684
But what I can see is that there is terrain almost tracing out, kind of tiling the crater, if you will, in almost hexagon type things that I can imagine are each about one-fifth the size of the crater.

11
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:27,968
Kind of like making biscuits in a small cast iron skillet.

12
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:49,375
In terms of color, I would say that the darkness doesn't really have as much of a discernible hue, definitely not any kind of tan or pink, just pretty dark without hue.

13
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,297
And I think that's all I can offer on this one.
