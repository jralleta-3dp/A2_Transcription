### Transcript 001

1
14:38:02,579 --> 14:38:04,501
All right, back with you on target 22.

2
14:38:04,981 --> 14:38:11,848
Now back over into the window number two with the camera and the long lens.

3
14:38:12,629 --> 14:38:16,793
And so just taking a look now and getting set up, but I'm gonna leave the audio on.

4
14:38:17,494 --> 14:38:20,937
So forget a few little ramblings here as I get set up on target 22.

5
14:38:21,118 --> 14:38:29,806
So I'm looking for that crater region and luckily have the long lens to help me get there.

6
14:38:29,826 --> 14:38:32,569
So gonna,

7
14:38:34,928 --> 14:38:36,650
index off of Jackson.

8
14:38:36,710 --> 14:38:42,415
Make sure that it's about in line with the southern part of Muscovian Basin.

9
14:38:43,616 --> 14:38:51,004
Again, forgive my rambling here as I make sure that I'm getting the right target and the right focal length.

10
14:38:51,044 --> 14:38:57,190
So it looks like you want highest focal length surrounding dark plains and central images of the region.

11
14:38:57,370 --> 14:39:02,775
So I'm gonna make sure that I've got the right

12
14:39:04,156 --> 14:39:31,564
Target, I think I've got the right target because I See a distinct darker region in that that I can pick up off the 200 milliliter 200 millimeter image in the lunar targeting package, so gonna go ahead and start with a Center image and work my way in with that focal length all the way to the highest so first image and

13
14:39:32,843 --> 14:39:40,931
is gonna capture both Jackson and Muscovian basins and work my way into what I believe that crater is.

14
14:39:40,951 --> 14:39:46,656
And I can really start to pick up that darker region.

15
14:39:47,096 --> 14:39:52,361
Really appreciate the camera now after trying to view some things with the naked eye.

16
14:39:53,723 --> 14:39:59,408
And so I'm gonna do that whole sequence of images again, working my way in.

17
14:40:01,278 --> 14:40:14,993
with the camera slowly changing the zoom lens but keeping the central focus spot in the same area.

18
14:40:15,013 --> 14:40:23,462
This looks like it's, just double checking where my next highest priority target is, Muscovian Basin, so looks like I'm good, so I'm gonna take a few more shots.

19
14:40:26,565 --> 14:40:29,108
Trying to keep at the highest

20
14:40:33,172 --> 14:40:39,061
focal length and kind of surround that area with a number of images.

21
14:40:40,463 --> 14:40:48,675
Changing a little bit the camera orientation relative to the window of Orion to just make sure I get some glare out of there.

22
14:40:48,695 --> 14:40:54,083
And double checking my shroud to make sure I don't have any light seeping in.

23
14:41:01,910 --> 14:41:10,622
Capturing a few good images of that area, the target 22 area with Jackson also in frame.

24
14:41:10,662 --> 14:41:16,390
It allows you to trace from Jackson to that area via some of the rays.

25
14:41:22,198 --> 14:41:31,731
And one last image zoomed out to capture both the Earth and Moon as it currently

26
14:41:33,061 --> 14:41:39,431
is oriented out window two and I'm just going to do another series with the camera oriented in vertical.

27
14:41:44,919 --> 14:41:56,977
It's a little bit harder to stabilize the camera in vertical but does give you a little bit more north-south extent.

28
14:41:59,321 --> 14:42:02,325
Man, Earth is beautiful out there so I'm just going to take a picture of

29
14:42:03,740 --> 14:42:07,425
a few pictures of Earth while we have the opportunity.

30
14:42:13,272 --> 14:42:30,433
Okay, a few bonus pictures of Earth there at the end, but I'm gonna close out.

31
14:42:31,575 --> 14:42:32,616
Target 22.

32
14:42:33,507 --> 14:42:35,097
and move on to Jackson.

### Transcript 002

1
14:52:02,714 --> 14:52:06,318
Starting the voice recording for target one, Whole Moon.

2
14:52:06,378 --> 14:52:12,886
We've just got visibility on the moon.

3
14:52:13,306 --> 14:52:17,111
And so target number one, taking a look at the observation actions.

4
14:52:18,232 --> 14:52:27,983
Now I'm gonna give you my general impression as I'm looking through the lens, as I'm capturing the Whole Moon with a mid-focus mosaic.

5
14:52:29,024 --> 14:52:31,287
Starting now with a north-south pattern.

6
14:52:31,705 --> 14:52:32,826
50% overlap.

7
14:52:45,402 --> 14:52:49,648
Coming down the limb of the moon to the left.

8
14:52:51,009 --> 14:52:55,475
Definitely could make out Muscovians very clearly in the lens.

9
14:52:58,258 --> 14:53:01,122
I'm having to concentrate on the snake pattern

10
14:53:02,333 --> 14:53:06,237
to get the 50% overlap and get high resolution images.

11
14:53:06,257 --> 14:53:08,559
Sure is beautiful.

12
14:53:08,619 --> 14:53:20,249
And getting really spectacular rays that my eye didn't pick up in the camera now that I'm zoomed in.

13
14:53:20,309 --> 14:53:27,436
Just completed the second pass on the snake.

14
14:53:30,018 --> 14:53:32,020
Again, very clear rays.

15
14:53:37,062 --> 14:53:42,527
Concentrating on the 50% overlap, so it might be a little choppy on my voice comm here.

16
14:53:45,750 --> 14:53:56,040
Near the southern part, I'm picking up a lot of the dark mari infill on some of those southern craters.

17
14:54:01,465 --> 14:54:06,630
Gonna give a quick look at my screen while I have a target to index off of.

18
14:54:07,538 --> 14:54:17,633
Targets look in focus on my D5 screen, so I'm gonna pick up on that target where I left off, continue the pattern up.

19
14:54:21,418 --> 14:54:23,681
Certainly feel like I'm getting 50% overlap.

20
14:54:29,570 --> 14:54:35,098
Overall, just concentrating on getting the mosaic well documented.

21
14:54:37,441 --> 14:54:40,245
before I make a few other observations through the lens.

22
14:54:48,798 --> 14:54:56,750
Picking up Apollo Basin now, beautiful in the resolution that I can see with this medium lens.

23
14:55:02,518 --> 14:55:03,820
Okay, struggling on the

24
14:55:06,888 --> 14:55:16,383
a limb that's to the three o'clock position out the window right now to just get the full mosaic and resolution.

25
14:55:18,246 --> 14:55:34,532
Camera's struggling a little bit on focusing, so I'm having to target the center of the moon or at least further in on the moon to get the far limb at three o'clock.

26
14:55:39,085 --> 14:55:50,315
Overall, I had the lens set at about 280, and taking a look at any other observation actions you want.

27
14:55:51,016 --> 14:56:03,788
So the biggest thing that stuck out to me as I took that mosaic was the colors of those rays, specifically up in kind of the northwestern quadrant.

28
14:56:04,448 --> 14:56:07,371
The albedo was a very stark difference

29
14:56:07,773 --> 14:56:10,100
through the lens versus what my eye could pick up.

30
14:56:11,083 --> 14:56:16,399
And the features across the globe are just spectacular and looking forward to getting into the next targets.

### Transcript 003

1
14:53:02,174 --> 14:53:06,041
All right, starting target 19 still in window number three.

2
14:53:06,101 --> 14:53:17,421
I've got a really good config with the PCD kind of set up in front of me where I can glance down at it and both look out window three and make the observations now.

3
14:53:17,481 --> 14:53:21,308
So starting number 19 with the three of three of the Whole Moon.

4
14:53:22,430 --> 14:53:26,798
I'll just kind of give you my impression from the Terminator going to

5
14:53:27,149 --> 14:53:36,864
the bright limb, so essentially from west to east, and make some observations as I do that over the course of the next few minutes.

6
14:53:37,165 --> 14:53:39,969
So right at the Terminator, I mean, it's black.

7
14:53:40,490 --> 14:53:44,136
The hearth out there is beautiful still, so my eye is still drawn to those colors.

8
14:53:44,857 --> 14:53:51,047
But deep in the Terminator, I can't pick out features until I get right to a pretty distinct line.

9
14:53:51,719 --> 14:53:55,202
Right now it's at, I think, Sokoski.

10
14:53:55,262 --> 14:54:02,108
The Terminator is really highlighting the terrain or the rim of Sokoski.

11
14:54:02,949 --> 14:54:07,673
The western limb of Sokoski crater is just really highlighted and the central peak.

12
14:54:08,854 --> 14:54:14,559
I can almost convince myself I'm seeing the shadow of the central peak of Sokoski on its western limb.

13
14:54:15,500 --> 14:54:17,562
That would be really interesting to see through the camera.

14
14:54:17,582 --> 14:54:21,405
Hopefully she's capturing some of that in the camera right now.

15
14:54:21,976 --> 14:54:24,579
The topography is really popping.

16
14:54:24,619 --> 14:54:30,065
Those craters are really distinct along the Terminator, north and south of Silkoski.

17
14:54:30,105 --> 14:54:43,519
And it's not too far past Silkoski crater, maybe one or two Silkoski crater diameters away that the terrain starts to lose some of that sharpness that the illumination provides.

18
14:54:44,540 --> 14:54:49,165
Another beautiful area, make sure I'm getting

19
14:54:49,735 --> 14:55:01,411
my orientation right is like the, there's Muscovians basin, which is starting to, starting to get some of that topography advantage from the illumination.

20
14:55:01,871 --> 14:55:10,803
So I'm really looking forward to keeping an eye on that one as we continue to terminate or continues to move towards Muscovians.

21
14:55:10,924 --> 14:55:17,953
But also that larger basin that's to the south and a little bit west of

22
14:55:18,203 --> 14:55:28,980
Muscovian basin that's about the same size is really just it's amazing how flat and stark that is across the center of that larger crater.

23
14:55:29,000 --> 14:55:41,199
As I move more mid in line with the lunar surface, you know, the reflections and albedo are pretty dramatic in that area.

24
14:55:41,319 --> 14:55:43,823
So I can definitely pick out some of the high

25
14:55:44,242 --> 14:55:46,104
albedo crater rays.

26
14:55:46,124 --> 14:55:51,571
There's one that looks almost like a perfect little star, a five-pointed star, almost central on the moon.

27
14:55:52,372 --> 14:55:55,976
It doesn't show up in any kind of images that I see.

28
14:55:56,017 --> 14:56:09,774
And moving down to the crater that's just south of that, I think that's Mari Injani, if I double check in here.

29
14:56:10,574 --> 14:56:13,438
Yeah, so it's around Aitken Crater, Mari Injani area.

30
14:56:13,925 --> 14:56:24,279
That terrain starts to get a little bit darker and albedo and maybe a little bit more sharp in the topography in that area.

31
14:56:24,479 --> 14:56:33,291
Not sure why my eyes are picking up a little bit more, maybe because of just the darker albedo of that area.

32
14:56:33,311 --> 14:56:35,293
I see the topography maybe a little more.

33
14:56:36,775 --> 14:56:40,320
Jackson Crater right now, if my eyes move back up, is just

34
14:56:40,570 --> 14:56:49,344
gleaming almost white with those crater rays just stretching across at least a third or half of the moon.

35
14:56:49,384 --> 14:56:59,099
Again, I mentioned previously that wedge of Jackson that seems like it's missing from eight o'clock to about two o'clock.

36
14:57:00,000 --> 14:57:08,333
Just cannot pick up any rays in that direction, but a lot of distinct other rays in the other cardinal directions.

37
14:57:08,853 --> 14:57:18,407
And then finally, the full eastern limb is pretty high albedo or high illumination right now.

38
14:57:18,767 --> 14:57:22,072
Just totally lose the topography along that rim as expected.

39
14:57:23,554 --> 14:57:31,806
And really hard to pick out any major craters, features, basins as my eyes move towards the east.

40
14:57:32,393 --> 14:57:35,777
Just one more quick word about the Earth out there.

41
14:57:36,298 --> 14:57:45,308
There's really great shot out the window right now with Earth kind of standing off in the distance, but still within frame of the moon.

42
14:57:45,829 --> 14:57:52,677
And this Terminator really makes a dramatic image that we're hopefully capturing for the world to see.

43
14:57:53,418 --> 14:58:00,747
So with that, I'll end Target 19 and take a look at here at Aiken and get started on our next targets.

### Transcript 004

1
14:54:12,805 --> 14:54:20,514
And then I can see a little bit of that.

2
14:54:20,534 --> 14:54:28,404
There's sort of a dull, sort of orange-brownish that is the background grey.

3
14:54:28,684 --> 14:54:35,912
The very bright, greater rays are overlapping that.

4
14:54:35,932 --> 14:54:39,477
I can see the ones from Jackson and Ulm.

5
14:54:39,497 --> 14:54:41,479
And it cooks very brightly here.

6
14:54:42,235 --> 14:54:55,448
I can see how that Jackson Crater Ray goes all the way down into a cave basin.

7
14:54:57,831 --> 14:55:04,397
My general impressions is that I'm just chiming on, looking here, just knowing that we are passing the moon.

8
14:55:04,417 --> 14:55:08,361
Just seeing the colors, I can really see the darkness there of the Mari.

9
14:55:14,146 --> 14:55:29,430
So I can see those pretty large features from both that South Lake and Bay Sand.

10
14:55:29,450 --> 14:55:35,800
It's sort of a different hue behind sort of a dark horn here than some of the colors that are behind.

11
14:55:47,828 --> 14:56:14,848
the moon like this and all of its glory it's just amazing it's really happy to be standing here like this let's see I can really really start to see some of those are there some um the train there

12
14:56:48,882 --> 14:57:04,545
So I think that is the end of my first recording.

### Transcript 005

1
14:56:02,832 --> 14:56:08,698
All right, starting number target two, the limb out at Ocea procularis.

2
14:56:13,223 --> 14:56:23,693
So gonna try to cover this in a series of photos at the highest focal length right along that limb.

3
14:56:23,834 --> 14:56:27,237
So that's about where I left off on target one.

4
14:56:29,090 --> 14:56:34,455
The highest focal length, trying to make sure the target's sharp.

5
14:56:34,475 --> 14:56:40,361
As I work down, trying to get almost 75% overlap.

6
14:56:46,167 --> 14:56:58,759
I'm also gonna give that more of a context by zooming out, targeting the center of target two.

7
14:57:04,443 --> 14:57:10,472
And do that again with another series of images at about 75% overlap.

8
14:57:18,263 --> 14:57:23,170
Definitely can see the darker parts of that target.

9
14:57:23,511 --> 14:57:29,940
All right, on the limb, don't noticeably see a lot of topography picking up just based on the illumination right now.

10
14:57:31,883 --> 14:57:34,146
Through the highest zoom of the lens,

11
14:57:35,054 --> 14:57:40,841
Definitely see a lot of albedo change across the transition.

12
14:57:41,922 --> 14:57:50,031
Take a few just centered in right on the limb, kind of pressing the extremes of the camera focus.

13
14:57:54,737 --> 14:58:02,766
And again, gonna take a fully zoomed out but centered image

14
14:58:03,286 --> 14:58:05,589
on that target and just work inwards.

15
14:58:07,212 --> 14:58:11,618
He's in the same center spot, but just changing the zoom.

16
14:58:19,770 --> 14:58:24,397
Okay, quick look at the observation actions.

17
14:58:24,457 --> 14:58:27,441
I covered a lot of the focus changes that I was making.

18
14:58:27,481 --> 14:58:32,128
The color is pretty stark in that area, goes from the dark

19
14:58:32,480 --> 14:58:53,461
black of the part of the target that is centered on the target image seen in the LTP, and then has a pretty stark transition from that dark area into the lighter albedo areas, kind of towards Ohm Crater Crater as you make your way out that way.

20
14:58:55,463 --> 14:59:01,930
I could pick it up, the resolution of Marius Hills, but not as much topography as I thought I would see along the

21
14:59:02,180 --> 14:59:05,455
that complex rim.

22
14:59:05,475 --> 14:59:09,675
I'm going to end voice recording here and move on to target three.

### Transcript 006

1
15:01:03,727 --> 15:01:06,431
All right, starting target three, Orientale Basin.

2
15:01:06,811 --> 15:01:15,482
Looking for a mosaic of the entire feature, west to east snake pattern with 50% overlap with the highest focal length.

3
15:01:15,502 --> 15:01:18,426
So I'm at the 400 focal length.

4
15:01:18,887 --> 15:01:30,162
First off, I'm gonna take more of a context photo of Orientale Basin with the red square dead center, and then start that mosaic.

5
15:01:30,322 --> 15:01:32,805
So that should provide context for a mosaic.

6
15:01:34,709 --> 15:01:42,985
I'm almost gonna go for 75% overlap and really blast across the top of Oriental, west to east.

7
15:01:47,814 --> 15:01:48,616
Second pass.

8
15:01:54,727 --> 15:01:56,751
Across the center of Oriental.

9
15:02:03,785 --> 15:02:08,030
third pass across the bottom of Oriental.

10
15:02:10,752 --> 15:02:17,480
Had a couple camera fires there that only caught one or two images out of the three stack.

11
15:02:18,721 --> 15:02:27,210
And again, finishing off that target with a context photo at about mid-zoom level, about 200.

12
15:02:34,160 --> 15:02:36,643
So I see that's a high-priority target.

13
15:02:37,183 --> 15:02:41,128
It captured everything at least at 50% overlap.

14
15:02:41,708 --> 15:02:46,594
Saw a lot of the annular ring and ejecta structure as I was taking those photos.

15
15:02:47,214 --> 15:02:53,622
I'm also gonna make an annotation since that's a high-priority target with a wavefowl.

16
15:02:54,583 --> 15:02:58,607
Standby for that, but incredible target overall.

17
15:03:00,249 --> 15:03:03,913
The annular ring does start to pick up in that illumination condition.

18
15:03:04,400 --> 15:03:12,811
In fact, I'm going to take a few more photos just zoomed in right on the part dead center that I see the annular ring sticking up the most.

19
15:03:13,132 --> 15:03:15,315
That's kind of at the three o'clock position.

20
15:03:15,335 --> 15:03:18,419
Hip north is up the window north.

21
15:03:19,480 --> 15:03:25,228
Also some spectacular topography seen at the smaller craters that are in Oriental.

22
15:03:27,591 --> 15:03:31,757
And a really good contrast between the

23
15:03:32,412 --> 15:03:40,520
the darker regions at the base of Oriental, the darker rim of Oriental, kind of from the 12 o'clock to the three o'clock.

24
15:03:41,681 --> 15:03:46,005
And that topography really stands out, as I said, in this illumination condition.

25
15:03:49,268 --> 15:03:54,393
Took a few more zoomed in pictures that just capture the entirety of Oriental.

26
15:03:54,873 --> 15:03:58,977
I'm gonna try one using the camera in a vertical position.

27
15:04:04,272 --> 15:04:12,088
And I'm going to end the recording here and put an audio recording to mark that in the D5.

### Transcript 007

1
15:03:00,537 --> 15:03:05,864
So now, this is Marie, I'm doing my observation of Orientale Basin.

2
15:03:06,405 --> 15:03:10,291
I can see the rim, the rings of Oriental.

3
15:03:11,212 --> 15:03:20,886
I can see the Rooks ring on the, the Cordillera ring on the outside and the Oriental.

4
15:03:20,946 --> 15:03:27,535
And I can also see that dark annular ring around about five, about six o'clock.

5
15:03:28,296 --> 15:03:29,818
So I can see that the,

6
15:03:30,187 --> 15:03:48,989
There's not as much topography that I can see here that it really looks like the higher parts of the rings are a little bit lighter while there looks like there is the darker mare material that's sort of like hugging along the edge of that second ring that we are seeing there.

7
15:03:49,810 --> 15:03:53,194
Inside Orientale Basin, we see different mare patches.

8
15:03:53,955 --> 15:03:57,038
There's definitely two of them that look like they have different colors.

9
15:03:57,139 --> 15:04:00,042
It's almost like a horseshoe bottom of the inner part.

10
15:04:00,460 --> 15:04:03,685
I'm sort of like a, like a fatter horseshoe there.

11
15:04:04,346 --> 15:04:24,095
Um, and so that has sort of a gradational boundary as well as, um, and so I can see that that is sort of a darker gray, but then above that sort of filling in a little bit of that horseshoe, um, and going in around like one to two o'clock, um, it's a little bit lighter in color.

12
15:04:24,716 --> 15:04:29,843
Um, you could see sort of the rubbliness, especially on the, on the ring features.

13
15:04:30,177 --> 15:04:35,022
probably around like six, seven, eight o'clock.

14
15:04:36,264 --> 15:04:45,053
And so that's, it's more definitely rubbly, or you can see that the brightness sort of going off of that material as well.

15
15:04:45,113 --> 15:05:00,049
If I look to that annular ring, so it does look like that lipstick mark, but what's really interesting is that the top lip of the feature, the one closest to the mare, definitely has a darker, is darker in color than sort of the mirrored part on the lower lip of the feature.

16
15:05:00,383 --> 15:05:04,827
Um, I can tell that there is sort of a gradational sort of boundary there.

17
15:05:04,847 --> 15:05:13,996
Um, and it looks like it might be almost dispersing in a very lightweight on top of the rim.

18
15:05:14,016 --> 15:05:23,225
Um, the ring feature that we see there, uh, you, it also does not look like the two parts of the annual ring are actually touching.

19
15:05:23,886 --> 15:05:28,230
Um, sort of like they're separate just a little bit of where the crease of the lips would have been.

20
15:05:30,758 --> 15:05:36,549
I'm sort of seeing this as it's approaching the limb and so I'm sort of seeing it on the edge a little bit.

21
15:05:36,569 --> 15:05:46,468
So definitely I'm sort of seeing into the raised rim from about noon till 3 and then sort of flatter there below.

22
15:05:46,949 --> 15:05:49,915
So I'm going to stop this one so I can get back on time.

### Transcript 008

1
15:06:01,820 --> 15:06:02,801
All right, moving on.

2
15:06:02,901 --> 15:06:07,926
Again, I'm in window two with the camera and the shroud.

3
15:06:08,466 --> 15:06:11,569
Moving on to target four, Jackson Crater.

4
15:06:11,609 --> 15:06:18,295
I'm looking at capturing this in the highest focal length.

5
15:06:18,335 --> 15:06:21,298
So I've got the lens cranked over to 400.

6
15:06:22,059 --> 15:06:26,703
First gonna start out with Jackson dead center at 400.

7
15:06:28,404 --> 15:06:31,287
I cannot get the entire extent of the rays.

8
15:06:31,958 --> 15:06:40,429
So I'm gonna zoom out, capture one that captures the visible part of the rays, which is almost two thirds of the moon at this point.

9
15:06:42,171 --> 15:06:44,554
Still targeting the center of Jackson Crater.

10
15:06:44,594 --> 15:06:55,448
And then go back to 400 and capture a mosaic that is at least 75% overlap across the top of Jackson.

11
15:06:59,933 --> 15:07:01,375
Snaking west to east.

12
15:07:01,928 --> 15:07:04,953
Gonna come back through Jackson.

13
15:07:05,013 --> 15:07:14,948
And then a third pass just below Jackson.

14
15:07:22,259 --> 15:07:26,265
I'm gonna go ahead and make a fourth pass from east to west.

15
15:07:26,954 --> 15:07:33,103
Jackson now is not in the field of view, the crater proper, but the braid system from Jackson is.

16
15:07:33,143 --> 15:07:53,113
And just to make sure that I continue to see rays extending to the south, so I'm going to make one last pass at 75% overlap, 400 zoom lens to make sure I capture the extent of any ray system coming out of Jackson.

17
15:07:54,207 --> 15:08:18,808
Going to close out that photo, documentation of Jackson again from centering Jackson with the red square at the full extent out on the zoom and slowly zoom in, keeping Jackson centered all the way to the 400 millimeter portion of the lens.

18
15:08:21,471 --> 15:08:24,113
Incredible crater, incredible rays.

19
15:08:24,818 --> 15:08:27,261
very distinct in the camera lens.

20
15:08:29,443 --> 15:08:38,634
Maybe with my eye I can actually distinguish some of those rays a little bit further than what I was seeing in the camera lens, just based on these illumination conditions.

21
15:08:39,475 --> 15:08:51,028
And I really hope I captured Jackson appropriately in the camera because it's a beautiful sight to see via the naked eye.

22
15:08:51,464 --> 15:08:54,167
equally as impressive through the 400-meter lens.

23
15:08:54,227 --> 15:09:15,953
I wish I had a little bit more time to stare at it and pick up the nuance that the camera lens does afford me to look at, especially around the rim and some of the crater rings, or sorry, the crater ejecta rays to the south.

24
15:09:16,774 --> 15:09:20,138
Really interested in that wedge that's between

25
15:09:21,586 --> 15:09:45,045
uh 10 o'clock and two o'clock that doesn't look like there's any rays going to the to the north and west um kind of interesting just thought provoking as i kind of stare at it more through the camera lens took one last photo there i'm also gonna annotate that with the time stamp via the camera as soon as i close out this

26
15:09:45,397 --> 15:09:55,254
audio file and it looks like, take one last check at the observation actions and looks like I'm good on Jackson.

27
15:09:55,294 --> 15:10:06,072
Again, gonna capture a audio note in the camera and hopefully get you some of these photos down at the soonest possibility that we have.

### Transcript 009

1
15:08:01,448 --> 15:08:03,050
Alright, so this is Marie.

2
15:08:03,230 --> 15:08:04,852
I'm now on Jackson Crater.

3
15:08:04,872 --> 15:08:08,436
I can really tell where Jackson Crater is.

4
15:08:08,456 --> 15:08:11,660
It's super bright in my Lunar Targeting Package.

5
15:08:12,401 --> 15:08:16,746
And it's ray system is very bright.

6
15:08:17,707 --> 15:08:19,789
So I'm observing this with my eyes.

7
15:08:20,370 --> 15:08:22,112
I don't have the camera right now.

8
15:08:22,552 --> 15:08:29,380
I can see it sort of looking at about like the 10 o'clock and then about the distance of

9
15:08:29,900 --> 15:08:35,710
oriental in from the western limb.

10
15:08:36,572 --> 15:08:45,047
And so the inside of the crater is actually really bright, a super white, like dense, opaque white in color.

11
15:08:45,187 --> 15:08:54,203
And as you go a little bit further out into the crater basin, you can actually, that color sort of dimishes, almost like a lighter gray halo surrounding it.

12
15:08:54,588 --> 15:08:56,850
Um, I can see the rays of Jackson.

13
15:08:56,870 --> 15:08:59,173
They can go all the way, almost over.

14
15:08:59,193 --> 15:09:18,233
Um, not all the way to Muscovy and say, but they have about the, the size of Muscovy and say, um, Mari is about the distance between the edge of the, um, the Western most ray to the Muscovy and say.

15
15:09:18,601 --> 15:09:30,465
Um, I can follow trace those rays across almost down, um, over towards, I think I can trace it almost over towards Ohm Crater there.

16
15:09:30,966 --> 15:09:36,237
Um, so they reach over and those rays are crossing and then looking at the rays that go to the South.

17
15:09:36,778 --> 15:09:39,664
I can see it go all the way into South Polacan basin.

18
15:09:40,100 --> 15:09:45,285
Um, what's really interesting is that the, the ray system cuts and dissects SPA.

19
15:09:45,986 --> 15:09:52,813
Um, but it looks like there are some areas that actually have a denser, um, sort of ray amount of rays.

20
15:09:52,873 --> 15:10:01,923
So like the area between like one 32, probably like one 30 to like four ish is a very dense ray.

21
15:10:01,963 --> 15:10:05,166
It almost looks like part of a bow tie sticking out there.

22
15:10:05,287 --> 15:10:07,609
And then we have another really dense area.

23
15:10:07,893 --> 15:10:33,563
pretty much from the 5 p.m. 5 o'clock to like the 7 30 ish range so that we can see there and then there is that one ray system that comes through those rays are super bright they look like they're on top of a lot of that other sort of darker gray material and looks like they're just sort of laying on top you can see the brightness of these rays they sort of

24
15:10:34,201 --> 15:10:38,748
some of the other rays, especially the ones below in Crookes Crater.

25
15:10:40,350 --> 15:10:44,977
Looks like they're definitely on top of the ones from Crookes Crater and they look a little bit brighter there.

26
15:10:45,017 --> 15:10:52,748
And then also looks like there might be a secondary set ray that actually comes down as well.

27
15:10:54,090 --> 15:11:02,622
I really can't pull out any structures because I'm looking at this like straight on with nadir and the edges of the rays, they

28
15:11:04,660 --> 15:11:08,346
They are not like very sharp, but pretty sharp.

29
15:11:09,047 --> 15:11:15,116
I get, I would call it pretty sharp between the rays and the background material that I'm able to see there.

30
15:11:15,196 --> 15:11:22,908
And then the brightness of some of these smaller, brighter craters, they, they do still stand out on top of the ray system as well.

31
15:11:27,655 --> 15:11:31,140
Let's see, this is really neat to see how bright this is.

32
15:11:31,627 --> 15:11:53,989
I think the center of this crater is definitely one of the whitest spots that I can actually see on the moon right now, and then sort of fades outward from there.

### Transcript 010

1
15:13:03,136 --> 15:13:07,841
All right, made a quick switch there, so I'm now looking out window number three.

2
15:13:08,682 --> 15:13:12,827
I've got myself bungeed back down and got a clear view of the moon.

3
15:13:12,887 --> 15:13:24,300
Not as square on as I was when I was taking pictures with the camera, but it definitely is not interfering at all with observations for this next target coming up, which is target five, Crookes Crater.

4
15:13:24,360 --> 15:13:29,245
This is the first one of two of Crook's and

5
15:13:29,950 --> 15:13:34,576
I'm immediately wishing I had the camera to actually try to find crooks.

6
15:13:35,678 --> 15:13:45,150
I'm indexing now, taking a little bit of time to index up from Apollo to about 11 o'clock, 10 o'clock to find crooks.

7
15:13:46,412 --> 15:13:58,708
The camera definitely does allow you to pick up some nuance that helps you navigate to the crater pretty quickly, but got my eyes on crooks.

8
15:13:59,009 --> 15:14:02,993
and gonna take a look at the LTP to double check.

9
15:14:03,013 --> 15:14:21,633
One thing that is definitely sticking out to me is the larger crater that is just at the three o'clock of Crook's or the two o'clock, definitely is not sticking out as much as I look out at the moon as it is in the 200 millimeter image on the LTP.

10
15:14:22,574 --> 15:14:26,738
So it's a little hard to find Crook sitting on the edge of that crater.

11
15:14:27,359 --> 15:14:32,444
but I definitely think I've been able to locate it just looking up from Apollo.

12
15:14:33,485 --> 15:14:44,996
And right now it's hard to distinguish much topography given the illumination, but I am able to see a lot of color and albedo changes.

13
15:14:45,056 --> 15:14:55,206
The texture looks pretty flat without the topography popping out at me, but the albedo around Crux is a lighter tone,

14
15:14:55,642 --> 15:15:06,859
I'm almost seeing three different tones there, almost from a light gray to a mid gray to a darker gray as you get about two or three crooks diameters away from it.

15
15:15:09,022 --> 15:15:17,915
It definitely doesn't have any dark areas like some of the craters to the south that almost have the mare patches in the bottom of them.

16
15:15:18,876 --> 15:15:25,446
But the interior of crooks, if I stare at it really closely, might have like a little dark patch

17
15:15:25,882 --> 15:15:30,106
at the three to four o'clock.

18
15:15:30,487 --> 15:15:33,750
It's kind of like one of those mid-tone grays that I described earlier.

19
15:15:33,790 --> 15:15:54,572
If I look at the RAID system of crooks, I can extend it out about two crook crater diameters away.

20
15:15:55,109 --> 15:16:01,238
to the north and to the south at about five o'clock.

21
15:16:01,278 --> 15:16:13,775
There's one distinct part of Crookes Crater Ray that looks distinct, almost like a finger out to the four o'clock that I don't see in the LTP.

22
15:16:16,900 --> 15:16:18,602
It definitely is not as

23
15:16:18,937 --> 15:16:28,146
as vibrant of albedos that you see in the LTP images as you do as I'm looking out the window at the moon around that crater.

24
15:16:28,166 --> 15:16:38,936
It definitely is striking and very similar to the crater to the northeast of it.

25
15:16:40,578 --> 15:16:44,161
And so those two pairing look pretty closely.

26
15:16:44,181 --> 15:16:45,923
That crater is about halfway

27
15:16:46,308 --> 15:16:47,512
towards Jackson.

28
15:16:47,592 --> 15:16:57,803
So between Jackson Crooks and that crater that's between the two, I don't know the Name of, they all have about the similar albedo and similar overlapping rate pattern.

### Transcript 011

1
15:13:01,972 --> 15:13:06,298
All right, starting target 23 with the camera and Jackson.

2
15:13:07,500 --> 15:13:15,872
Captured a lot of Jackson when I was taking photos of the target 22 crater region area.

3
15:13:15,892 --> 15:13:26,848
So I'm a little behind on the timeline with Jackson, but I think I'll make it up here just knowing that I captured a lot of Jackson in that last crater or that last camera sequence.

4
15:13:27,503 --> 15:13:30,647
Gonna double check to make sure I get everything that you want.

5
15:13:30,707 --> 15:13:38,698
So you want photographs of the center of the entire ray system at the highest focal length and multiple overlapping images as needed.

6
15:13:38,738 --> 15:13:42,243
So I'm gonna go ahead and make some observations of Jackson when I do that.

7
15:13:43,044 --> 15:13:52,296
But again, look at all the images that I took of target 21, or sorry, target 22,

8
15:13:53,018 --> 15:14:00,291
because there's a lot of great photos of Jackson in there based on some of that image.

9
15:14:00,551 --> 15:14:08,064
Specifically going to try to target on some of the rays of Jackson with the highest imaging.

10
15:14:08,144 --> 15:14:15,617
So I'm going to take, I've got a series of images that zoomed in on Jackson from lowest to highest zoom.

11
15:14:16,002 --> 15:14:31,857
and I'm gonna take from the highest of zoom and work out some of the ray systems to the south and north of Jackson to the furthest extent that I can view them, which is a long, long way.

12
15:14:31,877 --> 15:14:42,567
So I just took a series of six photos to the south, starting at the center of Jackson and going south.

13
15:14:45,162 --> 15:15:04,406
at the highest resolution, did the same, a series of three going to the north, and then a series of five going to that ray that is headed towards Muscovian's Basin.

14
15:15:04,446 --> 15:15:12,216
And last thing I'm gonna do here with Jackson is capture it in a context photo.

15
15:15:12,376 --> 15:15:13,718
I've got a couple of these now,

16
15:15:15,402 --> 15:15:21,493
Make sure that I capture the whole upper northern two-thirds of the moon.

17
15:15:21,513 --> 15:15:30,109
And an image that is well-centered and frames all of Jackson Rays and includes Muscovian's Basin.

18
15:15:32,173 --> 15:15:34,838
Gonna take a few in a couple different orientations with the camera.

19
15:15:36,000 --> 15:15:38,625
Captures the whole eastern limb.

20
15:15:48,038 --> 15:15:50,241
and close out Jackson.

21
15:15:50,801 --> 15:15:57,869
Man, it's a really unique crater that the camera allows you to see some of the grade system like your naked eye does not pick up.

22
15:15:58,270 --> 15:16:13,067
The albedo doesn't seem to change as you get away from that central crater, but the central crater is a high albedo, definitely distinct and really dramatic through the camera lens.

23
15:16:14,077 --> 15:16:20,712
And with that, I will close out target 23 Jackson Crater and it looks like moving on to Jules Verne next.

### Transcript 012

1
15:13:01,027 --> 15:13:02,631
Okay, so this is Marie.

2
15:13:02,892 --> 15:13:05,138
I now have the camera in my hand.

3
15:13:05,760 --> 15:13:10,733
I'm getting situated, getting ready to look for Crookes Crater.

4
15:13:17,007 --> 15:13:22,254
I'm now over in the other window and now I have the camera in my hand.

5
15:13:22,555 --> 15:13:23,416
I'm testing.

6
15:13:23,456 --> 15:13:31,628
It looks like that I can definitely focusing if I go the whole way zoomed in and can see the whole disc as I'm fully zoomed out.

7
15:13:32,429 --> 15:13:38,037
So I'm starting with Crookes Crater with the, as I can see is a photometric target.

8
15:13:38,455 --> 15:13:48,266
Um, and so has some intense looking at the albedo and texture and the theme for exterior, um, craters.

9
15:13:49,527 --> 15:13:58,917
And so I'm going to try to look in and I can see where Crookes Crater is.

10
15:13:59,678 --> 15:14:03,282
Um, it definitely has some bright gray systems as well.

11
15:14:03,717 --> 15:14:11,286
I can see that it's about halfway between Apollo and Jackson, which does match where it is on my LTP.

12
15:14:12,407 --> 15:14:19,116
And so I've got this, um, I'm able to get zoomed in on it there and get some images.

13
15:14:20,477 --> 15:14:24,162
And my, the bracketing that was set up is still working great.

14
15:14:24,963 --> 15:14:30,349
Um, so I'm zooming out a little bit, making sure that you can see the difference between

15
15:14:30,717 --> 15:15:00,538
Apollo to Jackson to really get that in there when I zoom in a little bit more I can see some I can't really see any of those Terra structures that are discussed, but I can see the gradation of the of the ray system so I'm trying to follow these rays all the way back up to Jackson and If these rays are actually they're a lot more dense around the center that we see here I

16
15:15:01,497 --> 15:15:04,740
And they don't look as streaky as like some of the rays around Jackson.

17
15:15:04,840 --> 15:15:08,003
It's sort of like a, they're almost looks like flower petals.

18
15:15:08,163 --> 15:15:14,029
They're much more, um, lighter in color and sort of condensed as well there.

19
15:15:15,270 --> 15:15:19,935
And so it makes it a little bit more difficult to like really see that streakiness.

20
15:15:20,615 --> 15:15:29,884
Um, like I said before, I really can't see much of the, the, the morphology or the boundaries actually look pretty gradational.

21
15:15:30,252 --> 15:15:32,195
in the ray system as well.

22
15:15:32,235 --> 15:15:36,582
I'm not able to see any of those terrace slopes that we talk about.

23
15:15:36,622 --> 15:15:39,847
That center is a really, really bright albedo.

24
15:15:42,091 --> 15:15:57,576
And it's very similar, not as bright as the one that you can see above in Jackson, but a little bit more similar to the one that is a little bit more northeast that I could probably see.

25
15:15:57,995 --> 15:16:02,079
um, with my laryngeography review, if I felt like opening that right now.

26
15:16:03,821 --> 15:16:12,489
Um, and so I'm looking, I'm supposed to really look and see the relationship, the rays on the material.

27
15:16:13,030 --> 15:16:26,803
Um, it looks like Jackson's rays actually come across, might cross this one a little bit more, but the rays are more defined along the darker, the light gray background of the moon that I can see there.

28
15:16:28,032 --> 15:16:47,927
but they really don't extend that far, sort of about the, it's like, you could look like the ray system sort of fits inside something like, like Muscoviente can sort of cover that whole ray system right there as well.

29
15:16:48,108 --> 15:16:50,091
So I'm gonna save this one.

### Transcript 013

1
15:15:03,136 --> 15:15:05,639
All right, just starting Target 6.

2
15:15:05,840 --> 15:15:10,306
It looks like I'm a little behind on the timeline, so I'll make this one a little bit quicker.

3
15:15:10,326 --> 15:15:23,464
And I've definitely zoomed in with my eye, sorry, on Target 6, the Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and Bubba Crater, just south of Apollo Basin.

4
15:15:23,524 --> 15:15:32,637
The illumination down there is a little bit darker right now, so it's hard to pick out those two distinct craters that are next to each other.

5
15:15:33,325 --> 15:15:35,589
Actually struggling with that a little bit.

6
15:15:35,869 --> 15:15:48,009
I'm just indexing off of a dark patch that looks like to be the dark patch at the bottom of Bo's crater, if that's the one to my left or the west in the image.

7
15:15:49,091 --> 15:15:57,265
And that's the only one that I'm really picking up on is that Bo's crater to the left, if Bose And Bhabha Crater Region's to the right.

8
15:15:57,345 --> 15:15:59,248
And so again, just to make sure I'm clear there.

9
15:15:59,735 --> 15:16:03,881
So at three o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater in the image in the LDP.

10
15:16:04,342 --> 15:16:07,787
The one at seven o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

11
15:16:08,448 --> 15:16:12,314
And it's Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is actually popping out just below Apollo Crater.

12
15:16:12,675 --> 15:16:19,285
I don't see Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that distinct as what's captured in the LTP image.

13
15:16:21,348 --> 15:16:23,852
I will say a little bit more words about the color.

14
15:16:24,187 --> 15:16:32,516
So just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater, I do see a light patch that I don't see in any of the imagery on our PCDs.

15
15:16:33,177 --> 15:16:42,847
So there's a totally distinct little light patch just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is starting to really stick out to my eye as I continue to look out the window.

16
15:16:42,908 --> 15:16:47,933
One thing I will note is looking back and forth between the window and the,

17
15:16:48,352 --> 15:16:55,082
and the PCD, my eye does take a few minutes or a few seconds to adjust to pick up those subtle differences.

18
15:16:55,963 --> 15:17:11,406
So I've been trying to concentrate by looking out the window, but also make sure that I get the observations and actions in mind before I start the video recording so I can allow my eyes to adjust without looking down at the LTP too often.

19
15:17:11,960 --> 15:17:17,487
So just again, to focus on the color, albedo, and texture, I think I checked the box there.

20
15:17:17,567 --> 15:17:21,611
Texture's really hard to pick out in these illumination conditions.

21
15:17:22,673 --> 15:17:32,865
The only interior thing that I see is the bottom of bows, and that's the only reason that it's able to pick that out at all is a little bit of darker patch at the bottom of bows.

22
15:17:33,646 --> 15:17:36,729
And the relationship between the two is kind of what I described.

23
15:17:37,090 --> 15:17:39,773
I'm really having trouble seeing

24
15:17:40,073 --> 15:17:46,865
above a crater compared to Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and just really interested in that little white patch that's below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

25
15:17:46,945 --> 15:17:49,169
But nothing else really to add there.

26
15:17:49,530 --> 15:17:52,535
Kind of hard in this illumination conditions to pick that up.

27
15:17:52,555 --> 15:17:55,180
So that concludes target number six.

### Transcript 014

1
15:17:00,824 --> 15:17:01,926
Okay, this is Maria.

2
15:17:01,966 --> 15:17:04,429
I'm getting ready to go to my next target now.

3
15:17:06,031 --> 15:17:08,735
We are now looking for Bo's and Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater.

4
15:17:08,755 --> 15:17:11,679
So let me get that one highlighted here.

5
15:17:11,719 --> 15:17:14,463
So I'm looking a little bit below.

6
15:17:14,483 --> 15:17:19,170
I now have the camera, so I'm going to start at Apollo.

7
15:17:19,387 --> 15:17:22,731
and work my way down from here.

8
15:17:23,672 --> 15:17:26,816
Let me see if I can find where this is.

9
15:17:26,936 --> 15:17:33,303
I'm looking for the double set, a little snowman as I've heard some people call it before.

10
15:17:33,343 --> 15:17:41,192
It's really hard to find these ones down here, especially without this strong morphology.

11
15:17:41,864 --> 15:17:49,932
I can see I'm fully zoomed in on Apollo, and so I'm just gonna start taking some images around.

12
15:17:49,952 --> 15:17:55,157
Oop, I didn't collect my whole bracket, so I'm gonna restart that one.

13
15:17:55,318 --> 15:18:01,444
Go down by Apollo and do like a tiny little mosaic here.

14
15:18:02,865 --> 15:18:05,147
And so I feel like it's in there somewhere.

15
15:18:06,128 --> 15:18:10,673
Let me see if I can really focus on getting to where that is.

16
15:18:14,146 --> 15:18:16,529
So it's right down there near the bottom.

17
15:18:16,569 --> 15:18:22,197
Definitely a little bit hard to find without the morphology that exists down here.

18
15:18:23,239 --> 15:18:37,639
And so I really can't find exactly where these two craters are next to each other.

19
15:18:38,817 --> 15:19:07,272
hard to compare them maybe that's them right there I really can't pick them out I think this might be it but I really can't exactly pick them out for a comparison between the two so they're sort of blending in with the

20
15:19:09,243 --> 15:19:33,968
I really can't tell, does not, looks like the mare patch that I can sort of see is right above right above bows so I think I can find that mare patch, there it is and so yeah I really still am struggling but I think I'm right now centered on it and got a picture there

21
15:19:34,319 --> 15:19:36,662
Um, but not very well defined.

22
15:19:36,702 --> 15:19:48,018
I really can't find any of those central peaks, um, that I'm looking for inside of there or the terraced walls because the morphology isn't really coming out even when I'm zoomed all the way in.

23
15:19:48,959 --> 15:19:56,049
Um, and so it's definitely a little bit hard to see in this lighting environment.

24
15:19:56,129 --> 15:20:02,217
So, um, I'm going to go back and, um, finish up this recording and

25
15:20:03,327 --> 15:20:05,830
it a little bit more on time here.

26
15:20:05,890 --> 15:20:33,064
One of the things that is really interesting now that I'm just down here in SPA looking at this with the camera you can really start to see like how some of these craters look a little bit more depressed like a little bit how they don't look very strong but you can see some of that brightness those albedo differences

27
15:20:33,398 --> 15:20:39,393
That's sort of more representative of the rooms of the creators than actually the creators themselves.

28
15:20:39,553 --> 15:20:41,699
I'm going to look one more, once more again.

29
15:20:41,959 --> 15:20:43,443
Oh, maybe that is it.

30
15:20:44,205 --> 15:20:47,172
But it's definitely pretty difficult to find down there.

### Transcript 015

1
15:21:02,765 --> 15:21:06,590
All right, I'm starting Sudman Crater, target number seven.

2
15:21:07,591 --> 15:21:11,677
Taking a look now for locating it on the limb just above Oriental.

3
15:21:12,258 --> 15:21:17,264
This one's definitely at the extent of the human eye.

4
15:21:18,546 --> 15:21:28,840
I can't for say, using the LDP, flipping back and forth, that I for sure am seeing Sudman, target number seven.

5
15:21:29,748 --> 15:21:43,361
There is a few white specks out there above Apollo Basin that I can try to index off of, but really hard to pick up Sudman for sure.

6
15:21:44,122 --> 15:21:46,164
So let me just try to index again.

7
15:21:46,184 --> 15:21:48,726
I see the Apollo ring.

8
15:21:48,766 --> 15:21:57,274
I'm just not 100% sure as I zoom in on the LDP and flip my eyes back and forth.

9
15:21:58,300 --> 15:22:02,064
Um, that I am indeed being able to pick up Sundman J Crater.

10
15:22:02,144 --> 15:22:10,433
So, um, hopefully Marie's picking that up in the camera, um, at the highest focal length that she can.

11
15:22:10,453 --> 15:22:18,561
Uh, there is a lot of albedo little specks of white and kind of a medium gray field out there.

12
15:22:18,581 --> 15:22:24,107
Not a lot of topography is picking up in these illumination conditions, except for that rim of Apollo.

13
15:22:24,887 --> 15:22:27,430
Um, and.

14
15:22:28,895 --> 15:22:29,957
I'm sorry, Oriental.

15
15:22:29,997 --> 15:22:33,301
So every time I said Apollo previously, it's Orientale Basin.

16
15:22:33,402 --> 15:22:45,119
So just right above Orientale Basin, just that field of speckled white in that medium gray and just not able to pick out Sudman for sure.

17
15:22:45,159 --> 15:22:51,568
The rays of one of the crater in there maybe are a little distinct.

18
15:22:52,049 --> 15:22:54,773
So, but I don't think it's Sudman.

19
15:22:54,813 --> 15:22:58,378
I think it's more towards Ohms Crater and

20
15:22:59,067 --> 15:23:05,550
Yeah, with that I'm going to close out target number 7 and move to 8 just because I'm not 100% sure that I'm seeing Sudman.

### Transcript 016

1
15:21:00,655 --> 15:21:02,958
All right, I'm starting my next recording.

2
15:21:03,959 --> 15:21:08,265
And so we're looking for Sun Moon Jay crater.

3
15:21:08,285 --> 15:21:10,668
So let me get that one up.

4
15:21:10,768 --> 15:21:19,460
I'm looking for some good certain images and looking for additional images of the rays, if I can find those there.

5
15:21:19,480 --> 15:21:24,386
And so I'm looking for, let me turn my labels back on.

6
15:21:24,406 --> 15:21:28,772
Sun Moon Jay, it's gonna be up along the rim.

7
15:21:29,309 --> 15:21:32,695
or the limb here a little bit more above oriental.

8
15:21:33,858 --> 15:21:35,701
So let's see if I can find this.

9
15:21:36,022 --> 15:21:43,015
So I can see where Ohm Crater is, and then I can see oriental.

10
15:21:43,295 --> 15:21:47,824
And so I'm looking for partway in between there.

11
15:21:49,542 --> 15:22:12,512
so sort of using those as my guide points okay so i found um i found oriental and looking so i'm looking using this more as a rim target limb target um and so i'm going to start taking some images along the rim here the limb so i'm gonna go from oriental all the way up

12
15:22:23,495 --> 15:22:31,083
But looking here at the limb, I think what's really interesting is that the seam's pretty sharp.

13
15:22:31,143 --> 15:22:38,350
I don't really see too much of a change, sort of any fuzziness along that limb.

14
15:22:39,551 --> 15:22:52,945
Yeah, so this is definitely a harder one to see, but really looking at that limb,

15
15:22:53,347 --> 15:23:22,543
like I said before it's very sharp and so I can still see it's definitely a bit difficult to see there where it is but um and I really can't see I do see a little bit of the ray system that I saw there so let me I can see some of those chains of craters coming down I think it's that

16
15:23:25,072 --> 15:23:26,394
Above that.

17
15:23:26,614 --> 15:23:31,562
I think it's right in here And so I can see a little bit of that ray system.

18
15:23:31,662 --> 15:23:46,624
It's a very faint ray system from where I'm looking at right now it does show it's sort of like a sheet sort of just like powder on top of Obviously the regolith of the moon but much more of that sort of powdery extent

19
15:23:52,426 --> 15:24:07,320
I know my picture isn't turning at the speed the movie is so I can't really use it as well to know what it is with representative on the moon but that's okay.

20
15:24:11,944 --> 15:24:17,509
Definitely I can see some of those crater chains when I am fully zoomed in here.

21
15:24:19,631 --> 15:24:21,032
Very tiny chains.

22
15:24:24,590 --> 15:24:27,396
I thought I saw one.

23
15:24:27,436 --> 15:24:28,398
There's one right there.

24
15:24:28,979 --> 15:24:32,868
So I can see some of those crater streaks.

25
15:24:34,091 --> 15:24:36,375
Those impact little lines there as well.

26
15:24:37,578 --> 15:24:42,649
I'm going to clean this one up and get ready to go to the next one.

### Transcript 017

1
15:26:01,297 --> 15:26:08,844
All right, starting target eight, the Mari, Injani, and Swirls, the first observation of it.

2
15:26:09,565 --> 15:26:16,071
I'll spend a few minutes before, a few seconds at least, before I got on the voice recorder to make sure I've located it.

3
15:26:16,712 --> 15:26:27,642
It's more tucked in towards the Terminator, at least the West Terminator than I was expecting compared to the LTP.

4
15:26:28,043 --> 15:26:36,195
image indexing off Apollo, able to make my way across Labintz and then pick up where Mari Ingeni and swirls are.

5
15:26:36,436 --> 15:26:52,640
But given the illumination conditions right now, can maybe see just a little bit of the lighter tone swirls at the bottom of Mari Ingeni, but it is at the extreme of the Terminator.

6
15:26:52,720 --> 15:26:55,705
So picking up that albedo is a little difficult.

7
15:26:56,208 --> 15:27:02,595
What I do see there is a lot of the topography, so I do see the rim of Mare Injani.

8
15:27:03,617 --> 15:27:07,481
Looks like a very mountainous region, especially to the east of it.

9
15:27:09,423 --> 15:27:25,422
Concentrating a little bit more on the texture, I see a lot of texture also trending northeast from there towards some of that crater complex that is up from Mare Injani.

10
15:27:25,942 --> 15:27:34,892
And it definitely is unique in that area for some of that texture between Lubinsk and Mari-Injanai.

11
15:27:35,633 --> 15:27:46,424
One quick note, picking up at Lubinsk, there's a very, very bright spot kind of at the seven to eight o'clock of Lubinsk, a very bright spot.

12
15:27:47,826 --> 15:27:51,730
It's pretty small, but again, seven to eight,

13
15:27:52,537 --> 15:28:03,688
a clock from Lubinsk that's only right near the crater rim, not too far from the crater rim of Lubinsk.

14
15:28:04,069 --> 15:28:07,272
Back to Mare Ingenii, so the albedo, just a few more words on that.

15
15:28:07,312 --> 15:28:18,443
Like I said, the swirls at the bottom of Mare Ingenii are possibly being picked up right now with the naked eye, but it's a little challenging.

16
15:28:19,013 --> 15:28:28,463
given its location, hopefully as the moon rotates or as we pass by the moon, we'll start to pick up that a little bit more direct on.

17
15:28:28,663 --> 15:28:34,889
And so hopefully the second observation of Mare Ingenii will be able to pick that up a little bit better, or hopefully the camera will.

18
15:28:35,850 --> 15:28:38,092
The rest of Mare Ingenii is pretty dark.

19
15:28:38,753 --> 15:28:48,463
The Mare patches at the bottom are definitely some of the darkest down in that area as you track over from

20
15:28:48,663 --> 15:28:49,324
from Apollo.

21
15:28:49,364 --> 15:28:55,249
It's kind of at the same color as that dark patch at the bottom of Apollo.

22
15:28:55,989 --> 15:29:13,864
And so just for a comparison between the two, between Apollo, Mare Ingenii, and Labintz, I would still classify Apollo as the darkest, Mare Ingenii pretty close to Apollo, and Labintz, the darker patches, as a little bit lighter of the three.

23
15:29:15,025 --> 15:29:18,248
A few more words on Mare Ingenii.

24
15:29:19,443 --> 15:29:33,700
Just a really spectacular area down there that as I stare out at the moon a little bit without looking down at the PCD, my eye starts to pick up those subtleties that you start to see in the topography.

25
15:29:34,441 --> 15:29:42,030
Overall, one of the things that I'm really interested in is about that bright spot right off of Lubinsk at the 7 to 8 o'clock.

26
15:29:42,511 --> 15:29:46,075
So hopefully follow up with you guys on that during the debrief.

27
15:29:47,101 --> 15:29:54,327
So I'm going to end target number eight, Mari Injani in Swirls here, and I get that recording saved out for you.

### Transcript 018

1
15:27:04,081 --> 15:27:10,531
Okay, so I am now going back to my Lunar Targeting Package for number 9, Mari Inchnai.

2
15:27:11,312 --> 15:27:16,139
This is also the first of two observations for this target.

3
15:27:16,960 --> 15:27:25,833
And so I am looking at some of the color, albedo, and texture variations, working to get some images.

4
15:27:25,894 --> 15:27:33,565
And interesting to sort of look for, I know there are some swirls in this target, so I'm going to be looking for those there.

5
15:27:34,372 --> 15:27:36,936
And so once again, I have the camera in my hand.

6
15:27:38,137 --> 15:27:42,303
I can see Mare Ingenii.

7
15:27:42,323 --> 15:27:53,899
Let me see.

8
15:27:53,999 --> 15:27:56,122
And so I can see the Apollo there.

9
15:27:56,322 --> 15:27:57,804
And now there's Leibniz.

10
15:27:57,824 --> 15:27:59,907
And so I can see Leibniz.

11
15:28:00,680 --> 15:28:05,807
I can see Mare Ingenii there, so I've been able to locate it now.

12
15:28:07,089 --> 15:28:10,734
And so I'm going to work on getting a full zoomed in image here.

13
15:28:10,754 --> 15:28:24,192
Yeah, so it's definitely a little bit hard to actually see some of the swirls that are in there.

14
15:28:24,212 --> 15:28:27,497
I can see some of the terraced edges.

15
15:28:27,730 --> 15:28:30,554
It's because it's right there on the limb right now.

16
15:28:30,594 --> 15:28:49,644
It's sort of difficult to see some of those swirls and so I'm trying to make some good observations so when I come back around the next time that I could see these a little bit better.

17
15:28:50,826 --> 15:28:52,168
Let's see.

18
15:28:52,621 --> 15:28:56,405
I'm looking through the camera to compare some of the size here.

19
15:28:56,445 --> 15:28:57,467
It's about the same.

20
15:28:57,507 --> 15:29:00,911
That sort of mare material is very similar too.

21
15:29:00,951 --> 15:29:05,616
It's like the three feet across from Apollo to Leibniz.

22
15:29:05,636 --> 15:29:10,542
It's about also the size of the crater in Leibniz.

23
15:29:12,364 --> 15:29:16,729
I'm looking for some of that bright spot that you can sort of see.

24
15:29:16,749 --> 15:29:19,472
So it looks like, oh, I think I can see a swirl.

25
15:29:20,093 --> 15:29:22,677
Let me get a picture focused on that right now.

26
15:29:29,809 --> 15:29:33,535
And so, you can tell that Mare Anginae right there.

27
15:29:33,555 --> 15:29:41,067
It's sort of that part of the core, like if you think of it like an eyeball, you can sort of see some of those veininess.

28
15:29:41,568 --> 15:29:46,135
It's sort of like the Mare Anginae is divided into like the two separate spots.

29
15:29:47,549 --> 15:29:50,433
And so there's the top part and the bottom part.

30
15:29:50,493 --> 15:29:53,617
I can see the bottom part has a little bit of swirls.

31
15:29:54,097 --> 15:29:58,182
They fit about right in the square of my focus.

32
15:29:59,564 --> 15:30:04,550
So I can see on the limb right there.

33
15:30:04,590 --> 15:30:07,534
I think we're going to get a better view of these when we come back.

34
15:30:08,555 --> 15:30:12,700
But really interested for what those are looking at right now.

35
15:30:12,800 --> 15:30:14,923
But what I want to compare is the color.

36
15:30:15,359 --> 15:30:23,112
The color that I am seeing inside of Mare Ingenii, it is a little bit darker than the Mare that you're seeing in Leibniz.

37
15:30:23,673 --> 15:30:31,647
A little bit closer the color that you're seeing in the middle of Apollo, so I'm going to try to get an image with all of those in there right now.

38
15:30:31,667 --> 15:30:34,131
And so we can see between the two.

39
15:30:34,151 --> 15:30:37,857
Looking at the boundaries there.

40
15:30:40,537 --> 15:30:41,839
heavy and mungy.

41
15:30:42,700 --> 15:30:53,513
It's sort of, parts of it, like around the bottom of that top part of Mare Injani, it does sort of have that sharp, that sharp edge there.

42
15:30:54,013 --> 15:31:10,273
And then along the top part, as you get towards the brighter, like those brighter craters, sort of above the Mare, that sort of is a much more of a gradational boundary that you can see there.

43
15:31:10,810 --> 15:31:20,078
It looks like some of the ejecta from those tiny craters might come on top of the mare there as well.

44
15:31:21,299 --> 15:31:23,782
It's really hard to see any structures in here.

45
15:31:23,802 --> 15:31:32,289
Right now as I sort of, though it's a little bit on the limb, I'm really struggling to see any terraced features.

46
15:31:32,409 --> 15:31:36,353
I can see the rim, like the inner peak ring, sort of coming up.

47
15:31:37,234 --> 15:31:38,775
And it almost looks like the

48
15:31:40,443 --> 15:31:41,787
It's like a breached wall.

49
15:31:42,128 --> 15:31:51,595
You know, it looks like some of the Mario material sort of breached underneath, sort of that raised rim-like feature there.

50
15:31:53,741 --> 15:31:55,887
Alright, I think that's going to be the end of this one.

### Transcript 019

1
15:31:04,013 --> 15:31:05,435
Target 9, Labintz.

2
15:31:05,455 --> 15:31:14,486
So started to really take a stare out of the window at Labintz to follow up on my comments that I just had on Target 8.

3
15:31:14,546 --> 15:31:23,717
I think I concentrated equally on the Mare Ingenii and the swirls as well as Labintz during my Target 8 description.

4
15:31:24,578 --> 15:31:30,525
But I'm going to stare out at Labintz a little bit longer now and see, let my eyes adjust to that target.

5
15:31:31,026 --> 15:31:33,008
Again, just to reiterate what I said about

6
15:31:33,241 --> 15:31:36,945
target nine, or sorry, target eight, about target nine.

7
15:31:37,626 --> 15:31:51,903
I'm really interested in the dark, or sorry, the light, highly reflective spot that is at the seven to eight o'clock of Lubinsk.

8
15:31:52,083 --> 15:31:57,409
It definitely stands out compared to anything I've seen as far as a bright spot.

9
15:31:57,669 --> 15:32:00,733
I'm not sure if that's an illumination condition or more of a fresh crater.

10
15:32:01,186 --> 15:32:10,721
but it's right just outside the crater rim of Lubinsk and definitely is unique in that area as far as a brighter spot.

11
15:32:12,283 --> 15:32:28,408
I mentioned previously during my description of Target 8 that Lubinsk, the base of Lubinsk has kind of like a mid-tone dark gray compared to the basement of

12
15:32:28,827 --> 15:32:33,771
Apollo and Mare Ingenii.

13
15:32:34,031 --> 15:32:38,295
It's kind of a mid-tone compared to those darkest areas that you see.

14
15:32:38,335 --> 15:32:48,764
And Labinsk doesn't have as much topography around the rim as what I saw and described as the topography around Mare Ingenii.

15
15:32:52,367 --> 15:32:58,632
Just look down at the LTP to see if I could pick up the small little crater with the naked eye.

16
15:32:59,152 --> 15:33:04,600
in Lubinsk that's kind of at the 10 o'clock.

17
15:33:05,241 --> 15:33:11,449
So inside the floor of Lubinsk, there's like a raised rim at the highest zoom.

18
15:33:11,750 --> 15:33:12,991
You're gonna especially see it.

19
15:33:13,793 --> 15:33:21,463
And I cannot see that with the naked eye, no matter how long I stare at Lubinsk, hopefully the camera picks that up.

20
15:33:22,605 --> 15:33:26,290
I can see the crater that's kind of like the,

21
15:33:26,725 --> 15:33:41,129
If it's a Mickey Mouse on its side with Lubinsk with the ears headed to the east, I can pick up the crater that would be the up or the northernmost Mickey Mouse ear.

22
15:33:41,790 --> 15:33:42,451
I can see that.

23
15:33:42,511 --> 15:33:49,242
I cannot see the crater that has the distinct central peak in it in the highest zoom lens on the LDP.

24
15:33:49,462 --> 15:33:51,045
I cannot pick up that crater.

25
15:33:51,667 --> 15:33:57,376
Unless I really concentrate and allow my eyes to adjust out the window, I can just barely pick up that crater.

26
15:33:57,536 --> 15:34:00,660
And now actually I'm starting to pick up the central peak of that crater.

27
15:34:01,281 --> 15:34:12,358
But again, it's that adjustment of the eyes as you allow them to adjust out the window and to the illumination of the moon versus looking down at the PCD.

28
15:34:13,402 --> 15:34:17,586
Nothing else dramatic stands out to me about Lubinsk.

29
15:34:17,647 --> 15:34:21,751
Again, the topography is pretty muted in these illumination conditions.

30
15:34:22,312 --> 15:34:27,077
The albedo I described and some of the surrounding terrain.

31
15:34:28,298 --> 15:34:37,688
The only really unique feature is that bright toned features impact maybe to the seven or eight o'clock.

### Transcript 020

1
15:35:05,363 --> 15:35:31,877
Alright, so I'm looking up so Stefan L Crater L. It's sort of like another thing up on the limb there Just try to see is my poster supposed to change Okay, I was like I was like this is Get a picture of this limb before it goes away and all of a sudden it's not there anymore

2
15:35:32,397 --> 15:35:34,841
Let me show you what's happening up here in the cabin.

3
15:35:34,881 --> 15:35:35,682
There it is.

4
15:35:40,268 --> 15:35:50,603
So I'm looking for Stephan L. Yeah, so looking for Stephan up there.

5
15:35:50,643 --> 15:35:54,950
It's sort of around the 2 o'clock on the rim.

6
15:35:55,090 --> 15:35:58,675
I can still see that the edge is a little bit hazier.

7
15:35:59,026 --> 15:36:06,143
And maybe we should do the changeover, because it looks like they need a little bit of assistance here in the reconfiguration time.

8
15:36:06,905 --> 15:36:10,453
Yep.

### Transcript 021

1
15:40:01,516 --> 15:40:02,238
This is a test.

2
15:40:02,620 --> 15:40:03,502
Test, test, test.

3
15:40:03,743 --> 15:40:07,215
I see my button oscillating.

4
15:40:07,716 --> 15:40:08,639
That's good news.

5
15:40:09,462 --> 15:40:12,572
Hopefully my PCD is in the right configuration.

### Transcript 022

1
15:50:01,364 --> 15:50:04,147
Okay, this is Kelsey here.

2
15:50:04,167 --> 15:50:11,076
It is 1546 and I'm just coming on to observe the moon here.

3
15:50:11,116 --> 15:50:12,037
Excited to be here.

4
15:50:12,057 --> 15:50:23,952
My first target here is taking a look at the entire moon and I have to say this isn't the objective of the task but I see the Earth as well and wow does it look beautiful.

5
15:50:24,012 --> 15:50:30,240
So orient myself to the moon here is I think what I'm supposed to be doing.

6
15:50:30,676 --> 15:50:37,553
I will say it is gorgeous and as the LTP says it is indeed not made of cheese.

7
15:50:37,593 --> 15:50:47,318
I do see color variations starting to pop out you know I see at first glance I see the bright white

8
15:50:47,804 --> 15:50:54,076
Craters really popping out, especially those beautiful rays extending across the entire face of the moon that I'm looking at.

9
15:50:54,737 --> 15:51:02,252
I see what I believe to be South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, which looks a little browner in color and inside SPA.

10
15:51:02,637 --> 15:51:08,102
There seems to be dark mare patches, but not all the patches are the same color dark.

11
15:51:08,142 --> 15:51:11,286
They really range in albedo across the spectrum of grays.

12
15:51:12,347 --> 15:51:26,280
Muscoviens is right there popping out beautiful at about 10.30 PM on a clock, and I am facing my head where lunar north is to the top of my head right now.

13
15:51:26,300 --> 15:51:31,986
I will say the standout features that I see I kind of already mentioned are

14
15:51:32,506 --> 15:51:39,725
Muscovians, the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, and just the sheer variety of albedo you see across the surface.

15
15:51:40,507 --> 15:51:44,237
I'm going to go into my geography review tab here.

16
15:51:44,622 --> 15:51:46,224
just take a look.

17
15:51:47,325 --> 15:51:57,838
And what I'm really seeing is Jackson and the rays of Jackson extending beautifully over this far side view.

18
15:51:57,858 --> 15:52:09,533
I am also seeing crater rays extend in places all the way down into the South Pelican Basin and across the South Pelican Basin.

19
15:52:09,985 --> 15:52:20,235
I see Aiken popping out to the sort of upper left, maybe, again, like 1030 if the clock is SPA and I am pointed to the north.

20
15:52:21,236 --> 15:52:23,038
And it really pops out beautifully.

21
15:52:23,058 --> 15:52:31,667
And I actually see some albedo, some bright white material that's extending out to sort of the, again, the southwest of Aiken crater.

22
15:52:32,047 --> 15:52:36,111
Again, my orientation is that I am facing toward the lunar north pole.

23
15:52:38,825 --> 15:52:42,849
Let's see, what else did you want me to cover in this description?

24
15:52:42,909 --> 15:52:46,693
Comparison of features across the globe.

25
15:52:46,713 --> 15:52:54,921
I definitely see what you guys are talking about, about illumination angle and what you can tease out on the surface of the moon.

26
15:52:54,981 --> 15:53:02,848
For example, sort of right in the middle of my view, I can just really see a ton of albedo variation from those craters and the crater rays.

27
15:53:03,549 --> 15:53:08,494
But then as you look over sort of to the, again, Kelsey left side,

28
15:53:08,761 --> 15:53:12,286
You see a lot more topography and morphology start to pop out.

29
15:53:12,326 --> 15:53:19,675
You see crater rims really start distinctly over on the limb there.

30
15:53:19,956 --> 15:53:26,785
And there's some beautiful views that I'm getting both of the albedo in the middle and the topography over on the left.

31
15:53:27,986 --> 15:53:28,407
Let's see.

32
15:53:28,447 --> 15:53:33,193
Starting to see Zolkowski crater pop out on the left here.

33
15:53:33,293 --> 15:53:35,376
Looking forward to getting a view of that later.

34
15:53:35,761 --> 15:53:40,523
I'll leave it here for now and go on to the next target.

### Transcript 023

1
15:52:02,444 --> 15:52:08,814
All right, this is Angela and I am starting target 10, two of three, which is the Whole Moon.

2
15:52:09,935 --> 15:52:15,764
I have the camera and so I'm going to start my north to south sneak pattern.

3
15:52:16,546 --> 15:52:21,974
Mosaic was 50% image overlap.

4
15:52:21,994 --> 15:52:31,168
I switched the camera to my SD card, which I can't remember the Name, number of it, but I'm sure it's written somewhere.

5
15:52:34,017 --> 15:52:36,501
Okay.

6
15:52:36,521 --> 15:52:39,946
And you want me to be at mid focal length.

7
15:52:42,049 --> 15:52:43,411
So standby.

8
15:52:44,372 --> 15:52:44,672
All right.

9
15:52:44,692 --> 15:52:50,901
I'm around, uh, I'm just going to go up to 300.

10
15:52:50,962 --> 15:52:56,770
Uh, no, 200 seems to be perfectly adequate.

11
15:52:57,231 --> 15:52:57,471
All right.

12
15:52:57,551 --> 15:53:03,720
Starting from the north and starting my snake now.

13
15:53:09,927 --> 15:53:31,499
Yeah, I'm sitting upright at the moment, so the north to south snake should look pretty straight.

14
15:53:31,519 --> 15:53:38,550
So as I'm snaking, I can really tell

15
15:53:40,083 --> 15:53:49,351
the stark differences in albedo between the rays.

16
15:53:49,371 --> 15:54:06,746
I think of Jackson and of Crooks overlapping kind of the mar beneath.

17
15:54:07,207 --> 15:54:08,908
It's really quite stunning.

18
15:54:12,550 --> 15:54:18,240
Alright, so, kind of just snaked over Apollo's basin.

19
15:54:22,807 --> 15:54:24,831
And now I'm right about around Crook's.

20
15:54:28,216 --> 15:54:29,398
Passing over Jackson.

21
15:54:29,438 --> 15:54:38,153
It's really difficult to keep the camera

22
15:54:42,757 --> 15:54:43,639
steady.

23
15:54:43,699 --> 15:55:02,352
My body is very tense so I can keep it still and get that 50% overlap that you guys are looking for.

24
15:55:19,240 --> 15:55:32,921
I'm on my last snake now.

25
15:55:32,941 --> 15:55:48,184
I realize I probably made some pretty tightly packed together snakes, but I think you'd enjoy that.

26
15:55:52,349 --> 15:56:14,678
Okay, now I'm just gonna kind of look through my camera and give you some general impressions, which is, wow, yeah, the morphology on the Terminator is just really, stands out a lot more in my zoomed camera.

27
15:56:15,158 --> 15:56:16,500
General impressions, it's just

28
15:56:17,999 --> 15:56:22,064
that some of these colors are really subtle.

29
15:56:26,890 --> 15:56:43,592
There's a little bit of like an orange tone that I'm seeing like orangish red in Muscovy Ents that's standing out.

30
15:56:43,692 --> 15:56:46,015
Same with the

31
15:56:46,636 --> 15:56:48,158
same in Apollo Basin.

32
15:56:48,218 --> 15:56:56,389
But yeah, I think the thing that kind of dominates the landscape right now is just the craters of Jackson.

33
15:56:56,429 --> 15:57:09,946
They have just, they reach not quite Moskowience to the west.

34
15:57:11,769 --> 15:57:12,930
They reach

35
15:57:14,699 --> 15:57:44,301
definitely up until crooks and they're just big and bright and beautiful I'm sure there'll be more to come oh I see Earth let me yeah as I'm as I'm still on this Whole Moon I almost almost missed it

36
15:57:44,551 --> 15:57:54,225
but for the first time I can see Earth and I'm gonna take some shots of it even though it's not in our plan.

37
15:57:56,389 --> 15:57:59,553
It's just so beautiful.

38
15:57:59,613 --> 15:58:05,943
Hey, it's nice to see you all the way over there.

39
15:58:07,425 --> 15:58:10,930
And those are pictures of the screen and not the poster board.

40
15:58:11,737 --> 15:58:15,874
Alright, I'll end it there and pick up at Bavilov.

### Transcript 024

1
15:53:02,090 --> 15:53:22,410
Okay so I'm going back to my lunar targeting package to finish up my last one before we switch over which is Leibniz crater and so I this is still Marie I can still have the um the camera in my hand

2
15:53:26,997 --> 15:53:30,182
I'm zooming in to do that.

3
15:53:30,222 --> 15:53:44,787
I got some good pictures of this last time, I think with, um, in between the Marianginae and Apollo before, but I'm going to really focus on observations of Leibniz this time.

4
15:53:48,023 --> 15:53:57,652
And so what I can see in here is there is that brighter circular feature in the middle and sort of like the halo circle on top.

5
15:53:57,672 --> 15:54:06,481
And that's sort of in this, you can see that little raised rim in our lunar targeting packages.

6
15:54:07,141 --> 15:54:14,048
And so I'm going to be focusing on seeing if I can see the swirls in here and describe them as well.

7
15:54:18,854 --> 15:54:21,257
And so I'm now centered on the target.

8
15:54:21,617 --> 15:54:26,703
I can look and sort of see the sort of swirly spot in the middle.

9
15:54:26,843 --> 15:54:33,650
It's definitely, it's definitely brighter than the surroundings, but it's definitely still hard to piece out.

10
15:54:34,031 --> 15:54:43,582
Um, so it's sort of like, it's not super sharp and you gotta look at it for a while to really see if I can see those, um, pieces there.

11
15:54:43,602 --> 15:54:47,646
It's almost a little streaky, um, which is interesting to me.

12
15:54:48,250 --> 15:54:52,537
I'm looking at the wall of the coder.

13
15:54:52,597 --> 15:54:55,983
You can tell it's sort of like got a sharper wall there.

14
15:54:56,023 --> 15:55:02,474
I'm just going to take a couple of photos.

15
15:55:03,296 --> 15:55:08,304
I can see that one rim that's in there, that red circular, is really well preserved.

16
15:55:08,324 --> 15:55:10,528
It's just like a perfect little halo.

17
15:55:11,318 --> 15:55:34,831
Crater very circular and it's like uniform the entire way around interesting I'm comparing that Crater rim that's around 11 to like the one that's around like 9 839 ish so that one is a little bit of a brighter.

18
15:55:35,252 --> 15:55:37,495
It doesn't look as well preserved

19
15:55:37,728 --> 15:56:06,638
It's brighter, but it doesn't look as like as strong of a uniform rim as the higher one up here There's definitely some craters around here that It's hard to tell that sort of one of those that's about four o'clock looks like it is superimposed on top of Leibniz and then we have the And then we have that bright

20
15:56:08,288 --> 15:56:30,398
that bright crater ejecta exactly probably around the nine o'clock area that we can see there so it's definitely a little bit difficult to see in there looking to see if I see any textures inside that mare does look pretty smooth we see a little bit those white streaks sort of going

21
15:56:31,610 --> 15:56:33,753
within there, but it's almost like little wispies.

22
15:56:34,394 --> 15:56:43,766
So we see that circular center wispy, but it almost looks like I could potentially see one that's sort of like radiating from it as a slight wispy as well.

23
15:56:44,267 --> 15:56:54,040
And then the crater rim sort of degrades and becomes part, the whole Leibniz rim itself is not as sharp as what we have elsewhere.

24
15:56:54,080 --> 15:57:01,110
It's really hard to pick up on a lot of this morphology there, so really

25
15:57:01,546 --> 15:57:03,649
using the albedo here.

26
15:57:03,749 --> 15:57:10,137
And so the albedo that I can see, um, it's similar to the mare, um, of the crater below it.

27
15:57:10,218 --> 15:57:17,848
Definitely the, the, from about noon to like two is a little bit darker of what's in there of that C shape.

28
15:57:17,868 --> 15:57:28,482
Um, and from about 11 down to like seven ish, it's a little bit of a lighter, but you really don't have a distinct motion moment in between them where you see those boundaries crossing.

29
15:57:28,934 --> 15:57:41,998
So I'm going to, I'm really excited to have finished this first set of observations for you all and can't wait to keep looking at the moon and get back to it on the other side.

### Transcript 025

1
16:01:02,225 --> 16:01:04,507
All right, Houston, Angela here.

2
16:01:04,527 --> 16:01:12,055
I am, I was troubleshooting Kelsey's PCDs, so I definitely missed Babaloff.

3
16:01:13,296 --> 16:01:16,799
Trying to get quickly back into Earthset, because I see it right now.

4
16:01:16,899 --> 16:01:20,183
So let me get some pictures of Earthset.

5
16:01:20,663 --> 16:01:24,587
And I'm taking them of the screen.

6
16:01:29,792 --> 16:01:31,894
Yeah, okay, as I am,

7
16:01:32,954 --> 16:01:41,843
Looking closer, you want me to focus on an Earth atmosphere.

8
16:01:41,863 --> 16:01:48,589
I'm not seeing, it just looks like a perfect, clear-boundaried marble.

9
16:01:48,609 --> 16:02:02,303
Oh, yeah, maybe I'm seeing a little bit of blue reflection coming from, only I can totally see it when I'm zoomed in.

10
16:02:02,890 --> 16:02:15,768
but perhaps a little bit of this kind of neon, maybe not neon, like a, how do I describe that?

11
16:02:18,652 --> 16:02:20,194
Just like a true blue.

12
16:02:20,255 --> 16:02:31,210
And I'm checking my camera viewfinder to make sure that that color comes through, but I'm definitely seeing some

13
16:02:40,100 --> 16:02:40,501
blue.

14
16:02:42,703 --> 16:02:52,957
This is hard.

15
16:02:52,997 --> 16:02:58,043
In terms of atmospheric patterns, I see some swirling of moons.

16
16:02:58,163 --> 16:03:07,035
The bright white of Antarctica is much of a truer white than the gray

17
16:03:07,555 --> 16:03:33,445
of the of the highlands and so the the clouds and those are polar ice caps are a great comparison for a true white because now that I'm looking at those in comparison to the highlands especially when I'm kind of zooming out a little bit we'll call it the thing that's the the truest color is actually the

18
16:03:33,728 --> 16:03:45,143
the dead center of Crooks is probably what I'm seeing as like the truest white when I compare it to the clouds on the Earth.

19
16:03:48,007 --> 16:03:55,516
It's sad to see the Earthset behind the moon, but I know I'll see it on the other side.

20
16:03:55,536 --> 16:03:59,922
I got some pictures

21
16:04:01,268 --> 16:04:09,442
I'm just gonna make sure I get some of the all zoomed angles.

22
16:04:16,534 --> 16:04:26,331
It's really great to have it have the lens zoomed in as I can watch it go but also kind of step back and see

23
16:04:28,724 --> 16:04:30,126
with it, with my naked eye.

24
16:04:30,667 --> 16:04:35,153
And this is the moment where the moon fully disappears.

25
16:04:35,794 --> 16:04:47,050
That was a beautiful, beautiful thing that I just got to witness.

26
16:04:55,743 --> 16:04:55,963
Okay.

### Transcript 026

1
16:06:01,904 --> 16:06:05,028
Okay, starting a new recording.

2
16:06:06,230 --> 16:06:09,794
I'm glad I was able to capture Earthset.

3
16:06:10,075 --> 16:06:13,339
Let me actually make sure I can tag that picture.

4
16:06:13,359 --> 16:06:19,507
This is me tagging this picture.

5
16:06:19,567 --> 16:06:21,069
Okay.

6
16:06:21,530 --> 16:06:22,812
Uh, successfully did that.

7
16:06:22,832 --> 16:06:23,172
Sorry.

8
16:06:23,212 --> 16:06:31,303
This, that was information from Earthset and not my current target, which is target 13.

9
16:06:32,127 --> 16:06:33,272
Korolev Basin Basin.

10
16:06:34,959 --> 16:06:41,547
So let me get oriented on the objectives for Korolev Basin.

11
16:07:00,764 --> 16:07:26,198
Yeah, it's a little bit difficult to tell because Okay, I'm in my lunar geography review just to help get the colors back Yeah, definitely

12
16:07:28,000 --> 16:07:44,308
I see Crooks and I see Jackson and Korolev Basin is right underneath the high albedo crater.

13
16:07:44,549 --> 16:07:47,894
Okay, I think I've oriented myself.

14
16:07:48,616 --> 16:07:52,843
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

15
16:07:58,460 --> 16:08:01,444
Just making sure I'm taking pictures of the right thing, but okay.

16
16:08:01,464 --> 16:08:02,285
Understood.

17
16:08:02,345 --> 16:08:03,767
Feedback received.

18
16:08:05,129 --> 16:08:07,732
Let me go get some shots of Korolev Basin.

19
16:08:10,215 --> 16:08:18,045
It's actually easier to find Korolev Basin through my camera now that I can zoom in, so I probably should have done that earlier.

20
16:08:18,105 --> 16:08:27,758
Alright, so yeah, because even up here, even if I'm not 100% sure,

21
16:08:27,974 --> 16:08:31,399
that I'm looking at it, I will 100% get the photo.

22
16:08:32,300 --> 16:08:40,433
Because in my highest zoom length, there's a lot of overlap in this area.

23
16:08:40,733 --> 16:08:45,300
So I'm going to make sure I have good coverage of this zoom.

24
16:08:51,569 --> 16:08:57,458
OK, so trying to focus.

25
16:08:58,872 --> 16:09:02,718
in and let me figure out what you still want.

26
16:09:15,356 --> 16:09:17,339
Okay, let me look at some of this.

27
16:09:20,183 --> 16:09:24,709
The topography, which it's actually just it's just not that obvious, honestly.

28
16:09:24,729 --> 16:09:28,795
I wish it stood out a little bit more, but it's not.

29
16:09:29,315 --> 16:09:54,394
Um, I definitely have pictures of Korolev Basin in my viewfinder, um, but I'm just really not seeing any, um, of these kind of cryptomare, um, versus just like any of these, these textures that you're, um, kind of indicating on the, on the LTP.

30
16:10:01,968 --> 16:10:09,137
I'm honestly still not 100% confident that I'm observing the specific crater.

31
16:10:09,477 --> 16:10:12,240
It's just a little bit difficult to tell.

32
16:10:12,320 --> 16:10:18,047
But I can promise you that I have several overlapping pictures of this area.

33
16:10:18,928 --> 16:10:26,537
But in terms of description, even my zoom lens of my naked eye, there's not great topography that are showing up.

34
16:10:26,978 --> 16:10:31,283
So with that, let me continue to move on.

### Transcript 027

1
16:06:01,212 --> 16:06:03,594
Okay, Kelsey is back with you here.

2
16:06:03,634 --> 16:06:10,420
My PCD just froze up on me, so I had to hard reset the PCD.

3
16:06:10,661 --> 16:06:13,663
And because of that, I missed several targets.

4
16:06:14,344 --> 16:06:17,387
I missed Babaloff, and unfortunately I did miss Earthset.

5
16:06:18,187 --> 16:06:20,549
But here I am at Korolev Basin Basin.

6
16:06:20,569 --> 16:06:30,038
I will say at first glance, it is very hard to see Korolev Basin with the current view that I have.

7
16:06:30,288 --> 16:06:44,451
I can see Favaloff, which is of course one of the targets that I missed, but Korolev Basin is nearly impossible to detect.

8
16:06:45,834 --> 16:06:54,328
I'm going to take a minute and try to get oriented here, especially since I just kind of got out of observations to try to troubleshoot the PCD.

9
16:06:55,410 --> 16:06:56,852
You know, I do see

10
16:06:58,756 --> 16:07:23,025
understand I'm looking for kind of a smoother spot that's looks to be younger because it has fewer craters but at the current view right here all I'm really seeing I don't really see topography due to the the illumination angle right now and I'm looking and you know I see go back to my geography review here

11
16:07:25,958 --> 16:07:29,504
I'm trying to switch around my views to see if there's anything I can kind of do here.

12
16:07:29,564 --> 16:07:32,869
Figure that out.

13
16:07:35,053 --> 16:07:52,962
I think I can see Crooks beautifully, and I understand that Korolev Basin should be to the upper right of it, but it is swamped out by the sort of really bright albedo colors of a crater that's unlabeled in the geography review.

14
16:07:53,313 --> 16:07:57,580
That's sort of just to the upper left of Korolev Basin by upper left.

15
16:07:57,600 --> 16:08:03,970
I am still oriented in the window such that I am My head is facing lunar north.

16
16:08:04,411 --> 16:08:11,001
So it's just to to sort of the upper left left of Korolev Basin So, let me see here

17
16:08:12,770 --> 16:08:16,956
It's nearly impossible to identify any topography.

18
16:08:17,016 --> 16:08:24,527
All I see is sort of a white albedo patch in the area where I think Korolev Basin should be.

19
16:08:25,148 --> 16:08:30,276
It's not as bright white as the two craters on either side of it.

20
16:08:30,957 --> 16:08:41,612
It sort of just appears to be, you know, honestly, if you would have asked me to pick an area of the moon in my naked eye view right now, it's sort of the least distinct feature

21
16:08:41,862 --> 16:08:44,386
least distinct part of the moon that there is in my current view.

22
16:08:46,209 --> 16:08:52,879
So I'll take a look here and see if there's anything I can give you about your observation actions.

23
16:08:52,979 --> 16:08:58,788
But honestly, I can't really see any of the things that you're asking me to look out here with Korolev Basin.

24
16:09:00,030 --> 16:09:03,415
All right, Kelsey out and I'll move on to the next target.

### Transcript 028

1
16:11:05,161 --> 16:11:05,902
Angela here.

2
16:11:05,942 --> 16:11:14,991
OK, I am back with you and I see my next target is 14 Oppenheimer Basin.

3
16:11:15,212 --> 16:11:22,740
It's a high priority, so let me get great image coverage of it because I have the camera at the moment.

4
16:11:28,446 --> 16:11:29,246
Right, I'm gonna.

5
16:11:31,989 --> 16:11:32,670
Look at.

6
16:11:34,372 --> 16:11:35,073
Apollo.

7
16:11:35,093 --> 16:11:49,491
And then I'm going to zoom in and make sure that I can get Alpenheuer, which is right next to Apollo.

8
16:11:50,192 --> 16:11:56,981
Yep, just double checking my LTP that it is the cluster of three.

9
16:11:58,503 --> 16:12:04,210
Well, actually, what's obvious to me is that it kind of looks like three Mari patches within this

10
16:12:04,898 --> 16:12:07,042
within this greater crater.

11
16:12:07,102 --> 16:12:25,152
So I'll just make sure I get focus on some of the low points and the higher points so hopefully you can get that good mosaic of it.

12
16:12:30,076 --> 16:12:34,062
I will make sure to get Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin in one single frame.

13
16:12:34,322 --> 16:12:40,951
I just saw that target.

14
16:12:40,971 --> 16:12:44,036
Yeah, let me try to compare these two.

15
16:12:44,076 --> 16:12:57,294
There's a lot more diffuse boundaries in the Oppenheimer Basin Mare patches than the Apollo Mare patches.

16
16:12:57,354 --> 16:12:59,357
They're much more distinct and sharp.

17
16:13:00,299 --> 16:13:06,649
in Apollo versus Oppenheimer Basin, which is, again, that diffuse type of boundary.

18
16:13:08,952 --> 16:13:09,754
I'm also here.

19
16:13:11,757 --> 16:13:14,381
If I get at a better angle, maybe I can see this.

20
16:13:14,461 --> 16:13:18,527
So now I'm kind of clocked a little bit.

21
16:13:19,486 --> 16:13:23,610
differently, so if you see that change in angle, that's why.

22
16:13:23,650 --> 16:13:34,883
I'm just trying to focus on the crater ray that's coming from Crook's that's separating these two craters.

23
16:13:34,963 --> 16:13:49,358
Let me zoom out a little bit just to make sure I get Crook's in the photo, but then I will just like kind of slowly zoom in and then I'm at my max zoom now focusing on that.

24
16:13:50,536 --> 16:13:57,445
crater ray, which is almost at the boundary of Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin.

25
16:13:58,887 --> 16:14:19,733
In general, for the color tones and differences between Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo Basin, I would say Oppenheimer Basin has darker, deeper tones than Apollo.

26
16:14:22,312 --> 16:14:33,885
The deepest of the tones is of the three kind of dark patches that are within Oppenheimer Basin.

27
16:14:34,526 --> 16:14:45,838
The top one is the darkest.

28
16:14:55,707 --> 16:14:58,232
Let me just make sure I'm on timeline still.

29
16:14:58,272 --> 16:14:59,815
Okay, I am.

30
16:14:59,835 --> 16:15:12,518
Okay, I'm gonna leave it there and take a few more pictures.

### Transcript 029

1
16:11:01,398 --> 16:11:02,620
Okay, Kelsey back with you.

2
16:11:02,660 --> 16:11:04,843
It's 1607 here.

3
16:11:04,863 --> 16:11:07,848
And my next target is a high priority target.

4
16:11:08,108 --> 16:11:09,911
It is Oppenheimer Basin Basin.

5
16:11:10,472 --> 16:11:12,134
Let's see what I'm looking for here.

6
16:11:12,174 --> 16:11:13,997
I'll orient myself.

7
16:11:15,499 --> 16:11:19,566
Let's see, I see again Aiken Crater's been such a helpful guidepost for me.

8
16:11:19,646 --> 16:11:25,735
So I'm coming down to make sure I hit it.

9
16:11:28,415 --> 16:11:30,818
And wow, this one's a little hard to see as well.

10
16:11:31,018 --> 16:11:36,505
I do see Apollo Basin and it almost seems like Oppenheimer Basin is obscured.

11
16:11:36,565 --> 16:11:47,619
Let's see here by a, let's see, by a bright crater ray that's coming down from the direction of Crookes Crater.

12
16:11:47,639 --> 16:11:52,245
I see in the geography review Oppenheimer Basin should be just to the left.

13
16:11:52,630 --> 16:11:57,461
of that beautiful bright crater ray from Crooks that is totally dominating my field of view here.

14
16:11:57,481 --> 16:12:05,819
And I have to say, this is a challenging one to be able to identify, but I know how important it is to you guys.

15
16:12:05,879 --> 16:12:08,665
So I'll give it my best shot here.

16
16:12:09,185 --> 16:12:20,135
Looking at Oppenheimer Basin, to me with the naked eye, it looks like just an area where there's several smaller craters that are sort of nearby to each other.

17
16:12:20,195 --> 16:12:34,449
The smallest of which in my lunar targeting plan in the screenshot there, I see the tiniest, darkest crater in the LTP is also the darkest feature to my naked eye as well.

18
16:12:35,650 --> 16:12:39,073
It's hard for me to see morphology, honestly,

19
16:12:39,492 --> 16:12:46,581
because of the illumination angle, it's really the albedo that's popping out to me more than anything.

20
16:12:46,661 --> 16:12:53,329
So as for shape and size, it's a challenge to sort of pick that out.

21
16:12:53,369 --> 16:13:09,229
But I guess as I'm looking at it longer, I'm starting to see, I'm tilting my head to the right and I sort of start to see almost like a little face that's made by just eyes and a nose, a little face of three darker mare patches

22
16:13:09,496 --> 16:13:11,699
that are in close proximity to one another.

23
16:13:11,739 --> 16:13:24,435
As for the sense of scale, let me look at my scale bar here on the targeting plan, and it looks like the darkest of those patches is probably, oh, I don't know, 40 to 50 kilometers across.

24
16:13:25,316 --> 16:13:39,013
As for what I'm supposed to be looking at, which is basin structures in the fractured floor, I mean, I guess the only insight I can provide in terms of the question about pyroplastics is that

25
16:13:39,263 --> 16:13:49,277
darkest patch that's kind of like in in the 10 o'clock area if Oppenheimer Basin Basin were a clock with north as 12 o'clock is that that is more irregular.

26
16:13:49,317 --> 16:13:59,952
It appears to be not totally infilling an impact crater but rather its own unique patch with sort of rougher non-circular edges to it.

27
16:14:00,914 --> 16:14:03,297
I see here that I'm supposed to compare

28
16:14:03,698 --> 16:14:31,022
this to looking at similar deposits with Apollo which is I know the next target but I'll just say while I'm giving this target here that the darker patch in Apollo Basin is similarly irregularly shaped and so it again appears like perhaps similar processes formed them or at least that that's an interpretation but they do look similarly irregular.

29
16:14:31,702 --> 16:14:32,743
I will say

30
16:14:33,803 --> 16:14:48,082
The picture in the LTP is a little misleading because it makes it look like that, again, that crater at like 10 o'clock, if Oppenheimer Basin were a clock, is much more circular and distinct than what I'm actually able to see with my naked eye here.

31
16:14:49,404 --> 16:14:57,996
So the best I can really provide to you is a look at color and sort of distinctness of the boundary of the feature.

32
16:14:58,737 --> 16:15:02,562
Hard for me to tell spatially, which is younger or older,

33
16:15:02,744 --> 16:15:09,697
If you had to make me guess, I'd say that it appears to be sitting on top of a lot of surrounding features in the area.

34
16:15:09,737 --> 16:15:17,833
And I'll see if I can make some annotations in the OneNote, because I know how important this target is to you guys.

### Transcript 030

1
16:16:00,790 --> 16:16:13,871
All right, I'm starting this next target a little bit later because I took some time to go into the OneNote and sketch something in Oppenheimer Basin, although to be honest, I'm not totally sure how useful it was.

2
16:16:15,273 --> 16:16:18,038
But now I see my next target is the Apollo Basin.

3
16:16:18,058 --> 16:16:21,644
I know I talked a little bit about that in the Oppenheimer Basin description.

4
16:16:22,285 --> 16:16:28,114
Unlike some of the other targets in sort of my block of targets here,

5
16:16:28,516 --> 16:16:30,720
Apollo Basin, I have no trouble identifying.

6
16:16:32,262 --> 16:16:37,371
It is, you know, of course, near the edge of the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin.

7
16:16:38,432 --> 16:16:44,402
I can see it again in my current view, which is again, I'm pointed toward lunar north.

8
16:16:45,404 --> 16:16:53,798
I see it marked especially by its sort of irregularly shaped dark patch in the middle of it, which I believe to be mare.

9
16:16:54,200 --> 16:16:59,147
It's a little bit harder for me to pick out the ring structures that you guys are asking me to look at.

10
16:16:59,167 --> 16:17:05,496
Because again, I just really am not seeing much topography in this naked eye view on this sort of half of the moon right now.

11
16:17:06,257 --> 16:17:09,001
But I do see sort of the center mare patch.

12
16:17:09,021 --> 16:17:17,794
And I also see sort of that, I don't know, horizontal to my current view mare patch.

13
16:17:18,061 --> 16:17:35,192
That horizontal Mari patch is probably 125 kilometers long, and maybe again using the scale bar on the LTP, like 25 kilometers, you know, in height, so to speak, from where I'm oriented right now.

14
16:17:35,476 --> 16:17:44,125
three little fingers coming out to the bottom left at about seven o'clock from the bottom left of that dark linear mare patch.

15
16:17:44,666 --> 16:17:47,148
They look like fingers to my naked eye.

16
16:17:47,208 --> 16:17:58,420
Looking at the picture in the LTP, I can see that they appear to be bounded by some sort of topography there in the rim, but I don't see that topography from my view.

17
16:17:58,440 --> 16:18:00,522
All I see is those little fingers stretching down.

18
16:18:00,890 --> 16:18:06,956
There's also a third Mari patch that's much smaller and narrower, sort of oriented vertically.

19
16:18:08,298 --> 16:18:13,603
That's in relationship to the dark Mari patch in the middle.

20
16:18:13,643 --> 16:18:20,490
It's it's out to the left toward the sort of Western Rim Western from my current frame of reference view toward Oppenheimer Basin Basin.

21
16:18:21,091 --> 16:18:24,194
And again, it's it's less like dark gray.

22
16:18:24,234 --> 16:18:26,296
It's a lighter gray and it's also more diffuse.

23
16:18:26,957 --> 16:18:29,800
All three Mari patches thinking about sort of

24
16:18:30,640 --> 16:18:32,002
geologic relationships here.

25
16:18:32,883 --> 16:18:44,078
With the naked eye, I don't see a ton of craters in those mare patches, suggesting to me that it might be younger than a lot of other features in this area.

26
16:18:46,882 --> 16:18:57,897
In comparison to the Oppenheimer Basin volcanic deposits that you asked me to observe earlier, those two larger mare patches in Apollo are probably

27
16:18:58,906 --> 16:19:05,459
darker, darker gray in color than the mare patch in Oppenheimer Basin Basin.

28
16:19:06,120 --> 16:19:09,026
I don't see many structures or slopes or textures.

29
16:19:09,166 --> 16:19:13,354
Frankly, all I really see is color and albedo in this target.

### Transcript 031

1
16:18:01,027 --> 16:18:06,074
All right, Angela, back with you, starting on Target 15, Apollo Basin.

2
16:18:07,396 --> 16:18:16,849
Now, I talked a little bit about Apollo when I was describing Oppenheimer Basin, and I'm gonna continue to do so.

3
16:18:16,889 --> 16:18:22,377
I'm gonna make sure I have some good full view pictures.

4
16:18:23,138 --> 16:18:27,144
Body position wise, I am clocked slightly.

5
16:18:27,204 --> 16:18:30,308
I'd be like 90 degrees to the right.

6
16:18:30,845 --> 16:18:36,873
where the zero is the top upright windows of Orion.

7
16:18:38,055 --> 16:18:57,240
So just took a few pictures focused on the fullest zoom out and now I'm kind of clocking in focusing on the margins between Apollo Basin and Oppenheimer Basin

8
16:18:58,840 --> 16:19:06,691
And now I'm going to take a few pictures focused just directly on Apollo Basin, because that is the target I want to focus on.

9
16:19:07,713 --> 16:19:10,897
Oh, this is fun to look at.

10
16:19:10,917 --> 16:19:13,921
It's actually kind of hard to stabilize.

11
16:19:15,283 --> 16:19:19,609
So I'm just going to not.

12
16:19:20,150 --> 16:19:24,096
I'm just going to put my feet up to help stabilize myself.

13
16:19:25,377 --> 16:19:28,662
As I'm zoomed in on Apollo Basin,

14
16:19:29,114 --> 16:19:41,386
Um, it's really cool to see the, um, the bright mare crater that's above, if you call it like the eye, the right eye above that.

15
16:19:41,546 --> 16:19:48,092
And it's got some really good pictures of just making sure.

16
16:19:48,132 --> 16:19:48,473
Oh yeah.

17
16:19:48,493 --> 16:19:48,633
Okay.

18
16:19:48,653 --> 16:19:58,142
They, they, they come through in the pictures of the crater, um, the light tone crater ray, um, kind of over top of that.

19
16:19:58,342 --> 16:20:01,365
of that dark mare, so I'm glad that that comes through.

20
16:20:01,385 --> 16:20:12,055
I will focus on the mare in the center and the ring structures.

21
16:20:13,297 --> 16:20:13,957
Okay, yeah.

22
16:20:15,699 --> 16:20:17,180
I will focus on that right now.

23
16:20:18,662 --> 16:20:25,969
It's interesting that it seems like that mare in the center is actually to the right, but it is true now that I'm

24
16:20:27,215 --> 16:20:36,187
of looking at my naked eye and know that in the topography that mare is not the right but it's actually in the center.

25
16:20:36,227 --> 16:20:45,420
I'm going to take a few more pictures focusing on that ring to the north because it's actually not that obvious.

26
16:20:46,221 --> 16:20:49,105
I was expecting that topography to stand out a little bit more

27
16:20:49,507 --> 16:20:51,410
But it doesn't.

28
16:20:51,510 --> 16:20:59,500
So I've taken a few photos focused on the center but also did a few around the edges of that crater.

29
16:21:10,074 --> 16:21:18,906
So as I'm just continuing to zoom in and I focus on that center mare, there's definitely

30
16:21:19,291 --> 16:21:25,923
like a another ring that's to the to the right of the center more.

31
16:21:25,943 --> 16:21:32,354
And I think that, yeah, that shows up in the LTP topography as well.

32
16:21:39,566 --> 16:21:41,029
Let's see texture wise.

33
16:21:46,173 --> 16:21:49,356
The base of this crater looks quite smooth.

34
16:21:50,617 --> 16:22:01,788
Oppenheyer next to it looks more rough.

35
16:22:02,128 --> 16:22:05,571
So I would say Apollo Basin is the smoother one.

36
16:22:05,872 --> 16:22:14,880
And again, the mare has very sharp boundaries that are not diffuse.

37
16:22:17,543 --> 16:22:22,769
Let's say I got a little distracted by the beauty that is Apollo Basin.

38
16:22:24,691 --> 16:22:25,793
So let me double check.

39
16:22:25,893 --> 16:22:28,536
I think I'm right on time.

40
16:22:31,039 --> 16:22:34,263
Oh, all right, I'll keep recording for a second.

41
16:22:36,886 --> 16:22:38,327
All right, Kelsey, you want this camera?

42
16:22:40,410 --> 16:22:41,852
Here, switch SD card.

43
16:22:41,872 --> 16:22:45,576
All right, let me give you my SD card.

44
16:22:46,079 --> 16:22:53,789
And this way, I can actually record what SD card I have, which is SD card 1026.

45
16:22:54,110 --> 16:22:54,610
Slot 1.

46
16:22:55,211 --> 16:22:55,592
Huh?

47
16:22:57,835 --> 16:22:58,255
Nope.

48
16:22:58,295 --> 16:23:05,245
I don't know if it matters.

49
16:23:07,548 --> 16:23:07,848
All right.

50
16:23:07,868 --> 16:23:13,816
I don't know what to do with this, but this seems important.

51
16:23:13,957 --> 16:23:14,297
Oi, oi.

52
16:23:16,589 --> 16:23:17,790
Could you put that in the Ziploc?

53
16:23:18,992 --> 16:23:20,594
Now I guess I'll pause my recording.

54
16:23:20,674 --> 16:23:21,876
Oh, do you need to be in this window?

55
16:23:21,896 --> 16:23:24,479
I sure do.

56
16:23:25,420 --> 16:23:25,700
Window two.

57
16:23:26,101 --> 16:23:26,882
She's a beauty.

58
16:23:26,922 --> 16:23:29,225
She is a beauty.

59
16:23:29,725 --> 16:23:38,496
I've found that putting your feet on here helps stabilize the shifting of the chair.

1
16:23:01,229 --> 16:23:03,093
Alright, Kelsey back with you here.

2
16:23:03,113 --> 16:23:09,527
I have now swapped windows with Angela and now I have the camera.

3
16:23:10,088 --> 16:23:13,115
I have put my SD card, my own SD card into the camera.

4
16:23:13,135 --> 16:23:17,304
I forgot to look at the number of that so I'll report that at the end of my shift here.

5
16:23:17,324 --> 16:23:20,571
And I'm moving on to my next target which is a

6
16:23:20,855 --> 16:23:22,076
high priority target.

7
16:23:22,177 --> 16:23:27,763
It's the South Polar region, which is of course super exciting for future surface missions.

8
16:23:28,504 --> 16:23:32,649
And I'll just take a minute to kind of get oriented with what I'm seeing here.

9
16:23:34,352 --> 16:23:39,057
Let me just go ahead and zoom in.

10
16:23:39,157 --> 16:23:39,618
Oh, wow.

11
16:23:39,638 --> 16:23:41,981
Having the camera is such a different view.

12
16:23:42,021 --> 16:23:43,723
It's gorgeous.

13
16:23:47,264 --> 16:23:49,568
Okay, I've got some pictures here and zooming in.

14
16:23:49,588 --> 16:24:07,483
I see the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin with that, I don't know, it really kind of looks right now in my view almost smoother than, it does look a bit smoother than the rest of the moon, which is interesting because I know it's much older.

15
16:24:08,543 --> 16:24:28,211
Let me see, I'm zooming in on the targets I just described before I had the camera, Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo, and all those mare patches pop out even more now, making me think that the descriptions I gave to you of those targets were not nearly as useful as the descriptions looking through this viewfinder here.

16
16:24:28,271 --> 16:24:36,002
Those albedo differences pop out so much better, and I can even start to see some of the topography that I was lacking with the naked eye view.

17
16:24:37,113 --> 16:24:44,805
I know my near-term focus is on Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo because I just described it, but I'll expand my focus.

18
16:24:45,365 --> 16:24:47,629
Let's see what I'm supposed to be looking for on the LTP here.

19
16:24:49,311 --> 16:24:53,698
Topography along the lunar horizon and illuminated rim of Schrodinger.

20
16:24:54,699 --> 16:25:00,488
Oh gosh, it's hard to see Schrodinger.

21
16:25:01,717 --> 16:25:04,180
Yeah, it's really hard to pick out Schrodinger.

22
16:25:04,200 --> 16:25:06,384
I don't really think I can see it in this view.

23
16:25:06,424 --> 16:25:12,512
But I will take a look at the topography along the horizon.

24
16:25:12,572 --> 16:25:13,313
Let me see here.

25
16:25:13,333 --> 16:25:19,863
Yeah, I'm starting to see more topography pop out, certainly along that horizon.

26
16:25:19,903 --> 16:25:23,227
Again, the crater rims stand out so beautifully.

27
16:25:23,267 --> 16:25:25,210
I'm going to zoom in here and take a picture.

28
16:25:27,637 --> 16:25:36,411
And I'm just seeing dark mare patches, both circular and less circular in nature, pop out across the South Polar region.

29
16:25:36,912 --> 16:25:43,303
I'm going to take a few pictures highlighting the diversity of the mare patches that I see in the South Polar region.

30
16:25:44,224 --> 16:25:50,775
Those images just captured some bright white, very tiny, high, high, high albedo

31
16:25:51,346 --> 16:25:58,395
features that might indicate that they're young, fresh impact craters, which is, I know, of interest to the science team.

32
16:25:58,895 --> 16:25:59,556
Oh, look right here.

33
16:25:59,897 --> 16:26:06,825
That image I just took, I think, captured a crater that has significant diversity of mare in it.

34
16:26:07,786 --> 16:26:12,873
There's that beautiful Albedo ray from Crooks coming down in the middle of Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin.

35
16:26:13,413 --> 16:26:16,257
I'll zoom in on the sort of extent of it down to the bottom.

36
16:26:17,799 --> 16:26:19,581
Let me see what else I'm supposed to be.

37
16:26:20,860 --> 16:26:27,810
I'm supposed to be taking a mosaic of the entire illuminated region, north-south snake pattern.

38
16:26:28,872 --> 16:26:31,976
All right, and that looks like my...

39
16:26:31,996 --> 16:26:34,139
I'll take a minute and just get oriented.

40
16:26:34,159 --> 16:26:43,373
It's such a better view with this viewfinder.

41
16:26:43,413 --> 16:26:45,516
You can pick out so much more detail.

42
16:26:48,781 --> 16:26:50,243
I'm looking at it through the viewfinder.

43
16:26:52,079 --> 16:27:02,191
Alright, so now I'm going to take my mosaic.

44
16:27:03,432 --> 16:27:04,814
Let's see, I'm going to start here.

45
16:27:04,834 --> 16:27:10,701
And 50% overlap north-south.

46
16:27:18,670 --> 16:27:20,112
Still taking my mosaic here.

47
16:27:28,208 --> 16:27:38,970
Okay, I'm probably taking way more images here than is warranted, but hey, it's the South Poleaitken Basin, it's exciting stuff.

48
16:27:38,990 --> 16:27:47,668
All right, so I'm gonna go in, I think this is my last picture of this, so I'm gonna go in and add the WAV file, but I'll go ahead and stop the recording.

### Transcript 033

1
16:23:01,550 --> 16:23:02,912
Hey, Angela, back with you.

2
16:23:02,932 --> 16:23:12,026
I am looking at high priority target 16 South Poleaitken Basin Region, one of two.

3
16:23:12,046 --> 16:23:22,923
I don't have the camera anymore, so I will probably take some annotations now that I have my hand available.

4
16:23:22,983 --> 16:23:28,992
It was very difficult to do annotations with the camera.

5
16:23:38,590 --> 16:23:47,040
It's South Poleaitken Basin Region zoning in.

6
16:23:47,820 --> 16:23:52,045
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

7
16:23:52,265 --> 16:23:55,289
I wish I had the camera so I could see a little bit more detail.

8
16:23:59,674 --> 16:24:01,456
So let's see.

9
16:24:01,636 --> 16:24:04,639
I guess I can see a little bit of topography on the horizon.

10
16:24:04,699 --> 16:24:07,062
It's not quite right dead south,

11
16:24:07,565 --> 16:24:13,555
pole but there's some topography differences if I look to the east.

12
16:24:14,297 --> 16:24:30,585
I see a little bit more ruggedness in the in the perimeter and then a little bit more ruggedness in the boundary just when I'm looking west just because of the Terminator shadow.

13
16:24:35,932 --> 16:24:38,036
Okay, let me try and locate Schrodinger.

14
16:24:38,056 --> 16:24:40,059
Oh, okay.

15
16:24:41,802 --> 16:24:43,825
Yeah, I see.

16
16:24:43,905 --> 16:24:57,729
So that area where there's some topography differences in the perimeter on the western, the west of the South Poleaitken Basin is closer to the Schrodinger Basin zone.

17
16:24:58,790 --> 16:24:59,712
Actually,

18
16:25:02,155 --> 16:25:11,023
Now I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not seeing more of Schrodinger than what the picture in my LTP is showing.

19
16:25:24,514 --> 16:25:32,061
Yeah, sorry, I'm just trying to take it in and identify if I can tell Schrodinger.

20
16:25:35,230 --> 16:26:00,040
I'm not sure if I can but and it's a little bit cut off in my video so I can't see the exact tip but I was I was taking pictures of the screen

21
16:26:02,467 --> 16:26:32,102
there they didn't look good but if you wanted Earthset pictures I needed to take picture of the screen yeah it's interesting to think about the like

22
16:26:32,673 --> 16:26:49,433
us landing on the South Poleaitken Basin, but honestly, with my naked eye, I'm not entirely sure if there's much more I can say.

### Transcript 034

1
16:27:00,790 --> 16:27:01,991
Okay, Kelsey here.

2
16:27:03,513 --> 16:27:05,716
Target 17, Dewar Crater Region Crater Region.

3
16:27:05,896 --> 16:27:08,880
I will say that my voice recorder app is misbehaving.

4
16:27:08,920 --> 16:27:14,887
Last time only a power cycle fixed it, but if I power cycle, I will risk losing target 18, which is high priority.

5
16:27:14,927 --> 16:27:24,398
So I am going to hope that my experience last time wins out and the recordings are still there, even if I can't hear them back.

6
16:27:24,418 --> 16:27:28,283
So here I am, Dewar Crater Region is the next,

7
16:27:28,533 --> 16:27:29,654
target I have.

8
16:27:30,155 --> 16:27:36,603
Let's see on the LTP, it's kind of like on a line between Aitken Crater Crater and Muscovy End.

9
16:27:36,623 --> 16:27:37,243
So I'm gonna follow it up.

10
16:27:37,263 --> 16:27:38,625
Yep, I think I see it there.

11
16:27:38,645 --> 16:27:41,749
So let me see, go to the 400 millimeter.

12
16:27:42,489 --> 16:27:43,330
What am I looking for?

13
16:27:43,351 --> 16:27:46,414
Low albedo anomaly, maybe cryptomare.

14
16:27:46,614 --> 16:27:47,836
Okay, so let me see here.

15
16:27:48,356 --> 16:27:58,168
All right, so in the window, I am actually, my head is pointing toward sort of the right east side again.

16
16:27:58,756 --> 16:28:02,082
I understand it's the western limb, but it's to my east.

17
16:28:02,744 --> 16:28:07,453
And so the camera is pointed 90 degrees from the last pictures I took.

18
16:28:08,294 --> 16:28:09,296
I'm going to zoom in here.

19
16:28:09,316 --> 16:28:13,805
Do a regional, yeah, really pops out beautifully in the zoom.

20
16:28:13,845 --> 16:28:20,157
OK, going all the way to 400 here.

21
16:28:21,419 --> 16:28:28,548
And in that zoom lens, I can really see there's a diffuse patch of that darker material.

22
16:28:28,608 --> 16:28:31,071
Here, I'll get a picture of it.

23
16:28:32,813 --> 16:28:36,898
I'll get a picture of it with some context here.

24
16:28:36,958 --> 16:28:39,822
And let me see.

25
16:28:39,842 --> 16:28:46,650
Yeah, so it looks, it is diffuse, and it's especially diffuse as you move out from it.

26
16:28:46,690 --> 16:28:50,835
It's almost like several layers of diffusivity where it's darker in the middle,

27
16:28:51,220 --> 16:28:55,144
and then slightly less dark, but still darker than the surrounding terrain coming out.

28
16:28:58,007 --> 16:29:09,399
I think there are fewer craters on it than the surrounding area, suggesting, well, that doesn't make sense if it's Cryptomare, but I'm telling you, I don't really see a higher density of craters.

29
16:29:09,499 --> 16:29:13,102
It's just kind of the same as the surrounding terrain.

30
16:29:13,723 --> 16:29:17,447
So the only indication of anything really is that albedo color.

31
16:29:17,467 --> 16:29:18,628
I don't even really see

32
16:29:18,862 --> 16:29:21,931
relationship between the dark albedo and topography here.

33
16:29:21,971 --> 16:29:27,167
Take a nice picture and I'll move on to the next high priority target.

### Transcript 035

1
16:30:00,908 --> 16:30:02,169
All right, Angela, back with you.

2
16:30:02,189 --> 16:30:05,512
I am starting Dewar Crater Region Crater Region.

3
16:30:06,213 --> 16:30:07,073
I don't have the camera.

4
16:30:09,035 --> 16:30:10,156
I'm looking with my eyes.

5
16:30:17,222 --> 16:30:21,666
All right, let me try to identify Dewar Crater Region Region.

6
16:30:28,132 --> 16:30:29,413
It's a little bit

7
16:30:30,929 --> 16:30:55,553
hard because the base map in my LTP isn't like, is more topography based versus the albedo color.

8
16:31:01,085 --> 16:31:04,588
Ah, OK. Yep, I got it.

9
16:31:04,908 --> 16:31:05,509
I see it now.

10
16:31:06,650 --> 16:31:09,552
Oh, if I look away, I almost lose it for a second.

11
16:31:09,772 --> 16:31:10,673
But I can.

12
16:31:10,693 --> 16:31:15,938
No, I lost it again.

13
16:31:15,958 --> 16:31:27,647
No, I got it again.

14
16:31:27,768 --> 16:31:29,149
OK. All right, all right, all right.

15
16:31:29,169 --> 16:31:29,569
We're back.

16
16:31:29,829 --> 16:31:30,670
I can see Dewar Crater Region.

17
16:31:31,291 --> 16:32:01,230
um what i'm really focusing on is the sharp perfect looking crater um fresh looking oh just kidding i lost it again sorry guys i'm really having a hard time trying to get

18
16:32:02,341 --> 16:32:32,331
Doer It's almost like I really wish I had a camera to zoom in I definitely

19
16:32:33,880 --> 16:33:03,448
I mean I can see I'm poking back to my lunar geography guide because the image there is a little bit better for me no I don't know what that Name is it's just I'm using the crater within a crater that's butting against another crater that's around the same diameter and then trying to look straight up from that

20
16:33:03,935 --> 16:33:06,279
to identify Dewar Crater Region?

21
16:33:07,320 --> 16:33:12,208
Okay, I think it's a darker mare patch in this area.

22
16:33:12,228 --> 16:33:15,573
Okay, now I am confident I am looking at Dewar Crater Region.

23
16:33:16,354 --> 16:33:31,478
The way I'm clocking it is the two craters that are around the same diameter and looking straight up at the darker region and then below this kind of light, very light and bright crater

24
16:33:31,711 --> 16:33:34,715
above it, so I'm very confident I'm looking at it right now.

25
16:33:36,838 --> 16:33:44,449
Again, this mare in Dewar Crater Region is very diffuse and it's also lighter in tone.

26
16:33:44,569 --> 16:33:59,710
It's not as obvious as the rest of them, especially Aiken is pretty dark and so is Moskavians, but I'd say Dewar Crater Region is

27
16:34:00,635 --> 16:34:05,820
Maybe what I'm looking at, maybe some of the lighter, lightest toned mare, if that makes sense.

28
16:34:06,501 --> 16:34:11,786
Um, again, very diffuse, um, the extent of it.

29
16:34:12,567 --> 16:34:22,556
Actually, maybe I can take a screenshot cause I feel like the image that I'm looking at is not accurately cubbying the full extent.

30
16:34:23,057 --> 16:34:27,941
So standby as I take a tour region.

31
16:34:28,142 --> 16:34:28,482
Oh yeah.

32
16:34:29,322 --> 16:34:38,944
I can just annotate directly in to here in the LTP.

33
16:35:19,880 --> 16:35:27,772
Okay, so I'm just drawing what I'm seeing as the boundary of this mare.

34
16:35:30,375 --> 16:35:49,043
And then there seems to be another, maybe a slightly different tone of mare that's in an irregular shape around.

35
16:35:49,546 --> 16:35:50,808
I drew the annotation.

36
16:35:50,868 --> 16:35:57,517
Hopefully, I just want to show that there's a little bit of a boundary in the tones of the Mari in CoreLab.

37
16:35:57,577 --> 16:36:04,686
But again, these are, in general, pretty diffuse boundaries, but there is a slight tonal difference.

38
16:36:04,706 --> 16:36:19,165
So I wouldn't take that line as super sharp, but I can see a distinction in those shapes.

### Transcript 036

1
16:31:00,993 --> 16:31:10,066
All right, coming up on my next, and I believe last target before the swap, wow, that time flew by, it's Tsiolkovsky Crater here and the Terminator.

2
16:31:10,146 --> 16:31:20,000
So let's go in here and see that I'm looking for Tsiolkovsky, which is right along the Terminator.

3
16:31:20,020 --> 16:31:26,489
I actually can see it fairly decently popping out along the Terminator now.

4
16:31:27,831 --> 16:31:30,915
And I can see that the central peak pops up in the middle.

5
16:31:31,807 --> 16:31:33,490
Let me see if I can take a picture of that.

6
16:31:34,852 --> 16:31:35,272
Let's see.

7
16:31:35,433 --> 16:31:37,296
Same orientation as the last target.

8
16:31:38,197 --> 16:31:40,621
So my head is pointing sort of toward the right here.

9
16:31:40,641 --> 16:31:43,105
I'm going to take one all the way at 180.

10
16:31:43,365 --> 16:31:47,812
And I'm going to zoom in to 400 here.

11
16:31:47,852 --> 16:31:58,168
I will say, a couple times the cameras bumped the microphone, so I don't know how well that's going to impact audio quality.

12
16:31:59,212 --> 16:32:02,157
But man, that central peak of Silkoski is beauty.

13
16:32:02,177 --> 16:32:03,800
I can see why it's Reed's favorite crater.

14
16:32:07,426 --> 16:32:07,947
Let's see.

15
16:32:08,788 --> 16:32:10,070
Mosaic of Hull Terminator.

16
16:32:10,131 --> 16:32:12,675
Okay, let's see here.

17
16:32:14,738 --> 16:32:16,541
Highest focal length for individual features.

18
16:32:16,702 --> 16:32:18,244
Oh boy, that's gonna be a lot of images.

19
16:32:19,106 --> 16:32:24,595
As I'm saying this, I think that that South Polar Region mosaic wasn't necessarily all the way zoomed in, so I apologize for that.

20
16:32:52,165 --> 16:32:53,626
All right, I got that mosaic.

21
16:32:54,928 --> 16:33:02,815
And now I'm looking at, for Tsiolkovsky, color-albedo texture variations, crater interior and exterior.

22
16:33:02,835 --> 16:33:03,435
Let's see here.

23
16:33:07,779 --> 16:33:21,632
So zooming in here, I do see, again, the crater, the inside of the crater is fully dark because it's in shadow, but you can see the central peak popping out, and it's nice and bright and white.

24
16:33:22,490 --> 16:33:26,294
in the middle there, right in the middle of Tsiolkovsky's o'clock.

25
16:33:27,254 --> 16:33:33,160
I can't tell, but it seems like in the sort of 10 to 11 p.m. if Tsiolkovsky was o'clock.

26
16:33:35,622 --> 16:33:40,947
No, sorry, it's about nine o'clock if Tsiolkovsky was o'clock from my current body orientation.

27
16:33:41,448 --> 16:33:43,329
There seems to be a light albedo patch.

28
16:33:43,430 --> 16:33:47,934
I can't tell though if it's just because it's coming into the sun or not.

29
16:33:47,954 --> 16:33:51,417
I'm gonna take a picture of it, see what you guys make of it.

30
16:33:52,915 --> 16:33:53,999
All right.

### Transcript 037

1
16:33:01,212 --> 16:33:02,093
Angela with you.

2
16:33:02,113 --> 16:33:05,397
I got so distracted by my drawing at Dewar Crater Region Crater.

3
16:33:05,417 --> 16:33:08,680
I didn't realize I had a high priority target up next.

4
16:33:08,841 --> 16:33:20,414
So I think I'm a little bit, I'm definitely behind in my Sikofsky observations.

5
16:33:20,654 --> 16:33:24,038
So apologies about that, but I hope you'll like that, that drawing.

6
16:33:24,698 --> 16:33:27,962
Okay, I am,

7
16:33:29,748 --> 16:33:59,012
trying to find Sikovsky yeah because I'm a little bit late to this observation I pretty much see the entire outline of Sikovsky and then the so like the rim of the west rim of Sikovsky is illuminated and the central peak is illuminated

8
16:33:59,414 --> 16:34:01,758
That's the view I'm seeing right now.

9
16:34:03,560 --> 16:34:24,072
So I missed the initial where it was just behind the Terminator because it looks fully outside of the Terminator.

10
16:34:31,021 --> 16:34:41,197
I think the only, oh, and now that I'm looking at it, there's a little bit more of the basin of the crater that's illuminated.

11
16:34:41,377 --> 16:34:51,032
So to the north of the central peak, there is a slight color that comes through.

12
16:34:51,473 --> 16:34:58,243
I will screenshot it and, oh, wait, actually it's already in my, I keep forgetting that it's already in my LTP.

13
16:35:03,168 --> 16:35:08,926
Are we taking a break?

14
16:35:09,006 --> 16:35:11,895
Is it time?

### Transcript 038

1
16:37:02,275 --> 16:37:04,839
All right, we're back with you in window three.

2
16:37:05,500 --> 16:37:14,573
We just did a successful switch over to have a little chat with the outgoing shift, and they're going to send up a sign set up here in a little bit.

3
16:37:14,593 --> 16:37:31,557
But I'm going to start with the exosphere dust get ahead target, target delta, because I see a little bit of a phenomena that's happening right on the Terminator, just proximal to

4
16:37:31,874 --> 16:37:32,715
Muscovy Ents.

5
16:37:32,795 --> 16:37:39,202
So I'm going to go ahead and try to describe that while I draw a little diagram of that area.

6
16:37:39,543 --> 16:37:53,779
So I'm looking at Muscovy Ents and if I go 10 o'clock towards the limb, the dark limb from there, I'm seeing a little bit of color change along that horizon.

7
16:37:53,819 --> 16:38:01,307
It's like a slight glare, but I could convince myself that it's maybe a little bit of

8
16:38:01,962 --> 16:38:10,115
phenomena of dust lofting or some kind of exospheric phenomena that my eye is picking up only in that area.

9
16:38:10,155 --> 16:38:19,910
I've looked along the entire Terminator from north to south, and that's the only area that I see that popping out at me.

10
16:38:19,950 --> 16:38:30,366
So I'm going to go ahead and end this audio for that delta exosphere get ahead target and try to get some of that annotated in the OneNote.

### Transcript 039

1
16:38:03,068 --> 16:38:04,690
Alright, it is Marie.

2
16:38:05,030 --> 16:38:06,912
I just got back into the seat.

3
16:38:07,152 --> 16:38:10,977
I'm going to try to look along the exosphere.

4
16:38:11,357 --> 16:38:15,301
Just sort of look and see if I can see any light coming up.

5
16:38:15,662 --> 16:38:20,447
So I have the camera in window 3 and window 2.

6
16:38:21,028 --> 16:38:22,369
The one without the cab cam.

7
16:38:22,649 --> 16:38:24,191
The one where I should be with my camera.

8
16:38:25,312 --> 16:38:30,578
So I'm going to start looking along the limbs here.

9
16:38:30,946 --> 16:38:33,008
I think Earth is going to be coming from.

10
16:38:34,910 --> 16:38:38,534
Looking to see if I can... oh my camera isn't on.

11
16:38:38,554 --> 16:38:39,415
My camera is on.

12
16:38:39,495 --> 16:38:43,259
We're still doing a little picture wise.

13
16:38:43,279 --> 16:38:45,781
We got our new card inside.

14
16:38:46,702 --> 16:38:58,995
That is card 1029 is in my slot 1.

15
16:39:01,372 --> 16:39:26,907
so i can actually now getting organized here so i'm going to be looking along the the rim and the exosphere trying to look and see if i can see any evidence i don't really see too much right now this looks a little bit fuzzy but it's it is hard because we know the Earth will be coming up from behind

16
16:39:27,663 --> 16:39:50,633
an area that is in darkness so it's still really hard but if I look at the disappearing limb taking some images as I look at that as well just going up and down oh I could see a little spot of something off in the distance there and that's very interesting a little white spot off of the limb

17
16:39:51,254 --> 16:40:04,727
I'm not really sure what that is but it's sort of like coming over from Jackson, halfway between Jackson, like following that about the 430 ray down.

18
16:40:04,767 --> 16:40:07,493
It goes towards where that little light area is.

19
16:40:08,075 --> 16:40:09,398
So that's the end of my...

### Transcript 040

1
16:43:02,191 --> 16:43:08,039
All right, we've got Earthrise coming up, and I can just hear the shutter clicking away over there, so I know Marie's on it.

2
16:43:08,720 --> 16:43:10,162
It's beautiful coming up.

3
16:43:10,182 --> 16:43:17,511
We're starting to see the blues and a little bit of continental browns, some atmospheric whites that are very dynamic.

4
16:43:17,852 --> 16:43:26,303
The Terminator line across Earth is extremely sharp and very dynamic.

5
16:43:27,905 --> 16:43:31,810
And that's all on the target.

6
16:43:32,127 --> 16:43:37,154
number Echo and man is it beautiful coming up.

7
16:43:37,614 --> 16:43:51,593
It's right in the right place and so it's right south of where I was seeing that exospheric phenomenon or a little bit of dust lofting that I described in my previous audio stamp for Delta.

8
16:43:52,415 --> 16:43:55,619
Man is it rising a lot faster than I expected.

9
16:43:55,699 --> 16:43:57,882
I think I see Australia so

10
16:43:58,300 --> 16:44:01,445
Good day to all you out there and everybody on Earth.

11
16:44:01,525 --> 16:44:02,667
It's good to be back with you.

12
16:44:02,707 --> 16:44:11,080
And hopefully you've got us back in communication and we can get you some of this beautiful data coming down.

13
16:44:11,420 --> 16:44:12,622
What a fabulous pass.

14
16:44:13,484 --> 16:44:16,608
And man, is it really cool to see Earthrise coming back up.

15
16:44:18,571 --> 16:44:23,138
It's changed a little bit of my perception of the moon with the colors.

16
16:44:23,239 --> 16:44:25,422
My eyes are adapting to the lights now.

17
16:44:25,925 --> 16:44:35,860
of Antarctica and some of that cloud deck and again seeing just such a sharp Terminator across Earth and it's really moving.

18
16:44:35,900 --> 16:44:45,834
I guess my first impression is how fast it's moving up or maybe how fast we're moving relative to these two beautiful planetary bodies that we've had a chance to explore.

19
16:44:47,297 --> 16:44:48,979
It is about

20
16:44:49,313 --> 16:45:02,916
two-thirds of the way up right now and continuing to change my perception the more that I see the whites come up and really spectacular view of the blues.

21
16:45:03,136 --> 16:45:07,423
Blues are just so dynamic, even more dynamic than

22
16:45:07,640 --> 16:45:10,484
our observation of Earth from ISS.

23
16:45:10,604 --> 16:45:17,713
I think it's just really cool to have so much black space with our beautiful blue Earth out there.

24
16:45:19,074 --> 16:45:31,770
And that blue is just so striking just with the gray tones of the moon in our foreground and the Earth in the further foreground or the background.

25
16:45:32,531 --> 16:45:33,492
It's really dynamic.

26
16:45:33,532 --> 16:45:35,014
And so just now

27
16:45:35,467 --> 16:45:50,966
The final little bit of Earth is creeping out from behind the Terminator, and we now have the full view of Earth with its own Terminator on it, probably about 80% of Earth that we see right now with that Terminator along the western rim.

28
16:45:53,009 --> 16:45:59,837
Overall, just fantastic opportunity to catch that Earthrise and really changed

29
16:46:00,323 --> 16:46:09,096
our view on some of the colors of the moon that we're seeing, but also changing our view on our place in the solar system and universe.

30
16:46:09,357 --> 16:46:23,057
So with that, hopefully we'll move on to some of those other dynamic targets that we've got coming up for the lunar observations and close out this last shift with a bank.

### Transcript 041

1
16:44:00,892 --> 16:44:02,594
Getting ready for Earthrise.

2
16:44:02,874 --> 16:44:03,975
I'm watching for it.

3
16:44:04,476 --> 16:44:08,220
I think I know where it should be coming from, but I'm not sure.

4
16:44:08,320 --> 16:44:11,543
So I'm just gonna keep looking right over the edge here.

5
16:44:12,344 --> 16:44:15,548
I'm just sort of waiting to see.

6
16:44:15,588 --> 16:44:22,295
Make sure that I can just keep imaging until hopefully that I can see it appear.

7
16:44:22,315 --> 16:44:29,683
It should be coming pretty soon here.

8
16:44:30,136 --> 16:44:31,938
Uh, maybe not right away.

9
16:44:31,958 --> 16:44:39,124
Um... Earthrise, yeah, it's now inside the Earthrise target.

10
16:44:39,685 --> 16:44:41,766
And so there it is, I can see it coming.

11
16:44:42,527 --> 16:44:42,807
There.

12
16:44:43,628 --> 16:44:44,969
Oh, it's beautiful.

13
16:44:46,130 --> 16:44:53,657
I'm making sure that my focus is on the actual illuminated moon so that way I can get a good moon focus photo.

14
16:44:54,518 --> 16:44:56,320
Oh my goodness, hello friends.

15
16:44:57,641 --> 16:44:58,962
This is so neat.

16
16:45:00,157 --> 16:45:04,703
I can start to see the browns coming up and a little bit of the white.

17
16:45:04,803 --> 16:45:07,967
Definitely those blues of the ocean coming up.

18
16:45:07,987 --> 16:45:12,032
You can really see looking at the limb of the Earth.

19
16:45:14,436 --> 16:45:16,839
Looking at the limb of the moon, it's very sharp.

20
16:45:16,859 --> 16:45:18,881
I don't really see any fuzziness there.

21
16:45:19,542 --> 16:45:23,948
So it's really just bisecting the Earth as it rises.

22
16:45:24,509 --> 16:45:26,591
Oh, here's some white that's coming up.

23
16:45:26,672 --> 16:45:28,594
I can now start to see

24
16:45:29,063 --> 16:45:32,028
A little bit of Africa is coming.

25
16:45:32,048 --> 16:45:32,990
Is that Africa?

26
16:45:33,010 --> 16:45:36,556
Nope, actually it's Australia.

27
16:45:37,116 --> 16:45:39,300
Good to see you all on the other side.

28
16:45:39,320 --> 16:45:43,407
I can now see the white of Antarctica.

29
16:45:43,427 --> 16:45:47,634
Let me start to zoom out and try to get that width.

30
16:45:49,597 --> 16:45:51,240
Oh, that's beautiful.

31
16:45:54,443 --> 16:45:59,990
Oh my goodness, I think it's just, this is just one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed in my life.

32
16:46:00,050 --> 16:46:08,101
Just here we are waiting for you all to return and just seeing our perfect little neighbor out there.

33
16:46:08,161 --> 16:46:12,046
I've seen it from, just absolutely incredible.

34
16:46:12,547 --> 16:46:19,236
We've looked back at the Earth a lot on this trip, but nothing like seeing it come out of the darkness on the other side of the moon.

35
16:46:30,860 --> 16:46:33,504
I'm gonna readjust my Pelotour real quick.

36
16:46:34,586 --> 16:46:36,730
Try to get back and get some more photos.

37
16:46:37,791 --> 16:46:39,855
Every little bit helps, right?

38
16:46:43,100 --> 16:46:56,462
The one thing, so like I can, to really tell you what I'm seeing here, I can see about the, it's coming out about the 930 position to the left of the moon, on the west side of the moon.

39
16:46:56,965 --> 16:47:05,355
I can see Antarctica, Australia, a little bit of Asia over there, definitely some clouds in the cloud system.

40
16:47:06,456 --> 16:47:12,163
Now that I can see the orange of Australia, that's really combining into some of the browns.

41
16:47:13,024 --> 16:47:14,847
Let me try to get that all in one photo.

42
16:47:15,447 --> 16:47:25,099
The browns in Australia are sort of bringing out some of the browns that I see in the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, like definitely around like

43
16:47:25,822 --> 16:47:30,648
Mare Anjanai and over from Apollo, sort of those browns are coming out.

44
16:47:30,728 --> 16:47:34,293
The blues definitely up with Muscoviense.

45
16:47:34,373 --> 16:47:38,698
Those blues sort of help match what we're seeing up there.

46
16:47:40,140 --> 16:47:43,264
Absolutely incredible to see it.

47
16:47:43,304 --> 16:47:52,015
It looks like the Earth could just fit so perfectly inside the Mare patch from Muscoviense and just absolutely incredible day.

48
16:47:52,956 --> 16:47:54,158
Oh, I'm so happy to

49
16:47:55,505 --> 16:48:17,665
see you all on the other side just a beautiful planet we have here and so contrasting after just looking at the as it was put from um apollo 11 the beautiful desolation of the moon is really in contrast with that beautiful dynamics of the Earth

50
16:48:26,943 --> 16:48:30,169
I'm going to make sure I get a mosaic of this Terminator too.

51
16:48:30,189 --> 16:48:30,931
Oh, I got it.

52
16:48:31,973 --> 16:48:35,460
So I'm going to start with the from north to south.

53
16:48:36,362 --> 16:48:43,015
I got my Terminator at the edge of my screen.

54
16:48:45,620 --> 16:48:47,263
Let's see on my 50% overlap.

55
16:48:59,039 --> 16:49:01,422
Now going a little bit closer to that limb.

56
16:49:01,763 --> 16:49:03,045
Going right back up.

57
16:49:04,126 --> 16:49:06,670
Trying to make sure I get some focus on me.

58
16:49:06,910 --> 16:49:08,753
Get the focus spots.

59
16:49:25,676 --> 16:49:27,038
Absolutely stunning.

### Transcript 042

1
16:46:01,735 --> 16:46:05,300
Okay, quick one on Ryder Crater, our target Foxtrot.

2
16:46:06,322 --> 16:46:10,147
Just running out of time and I want to make sure I get some of the higher priority targets.

3
16:46:10,168 --> 16:46:11,069
So this will be a quick one.

4
16:46:11,089 --> 16:46:17,418
I did take a long look at the LTP to make sure that I was able to train my eyes in on Ryder.

5
16:46:17,538 --> 16:46:25,330
And I think I've nailed it just below that larger crater that has a ring structure and a mare.

6
16:46:25,985 --> 16:46:34,037
I see Ryder pretty distinctly just given its higher albedo and some topography that's now popping out along the Terminator.

7
16:46:34,858 --> 16:46:47,436
And as I zoom in on the LTP and flip back and forth, I can definitely match up the two pretty similar diameter craters under the crater that is larger just above Ryder.

8
16:46:47,922 --> 16:46:49,465
and be able to trace that down.

9
16:46:50,426 --> 16:47:00,563
And then there's a similar three or four craters kind of in a square that allow me to pick up Ryder with the higher albedo of those four.

10
16:47:01,464 --> 16:47:14,385
Other than that, I can't say too much about Ryder other than it has that higher albedo visibly by my eye and it is really distinct.

11
16:47:15,952 --> 16:47:17,975
with some of the topography around there.

12
16:47:17,995 --> 16:47:25,765
Don't know how to explain it, but there's a very distinct topography, almost looks like deeper crater in that area.

13
16:47:26,586 --> 16:47:30,291
I think that's one just to the west of Ryder, the higher albedo one.

14
16:47:32,714 --> 16:47:44,490
As I zoom in, yeah, for sure, the one that looks like a deeper crater is to the west of Ryder, but there's a series of four craters there that make about the same diameters to each other.

15
16:47:44,842 --> 16:47:49,350
And rider is that higher albedo one, which my eye does pick up out the window.

### Transcript 043

1
16:47:00,031 --> 16:47:01,313
start on Ryder Crater.

2
16:47:01,413 --> 16:47:07,845
I got really distracted during Earthrise and so I'm gonna get going on this one right now.

3
16:47:08,406 --> 16:47:17,421
I can see it's down along the southern, the southern limb and the South Poleaitken Basin Acon and so I'm using this again Marie.

4
16:47:17,642 --> 16:47:22,470
I'm looking for Ryder with my camera along the southern rim.

5
16:47:22,691 --> 16:47:24,013
I'm looking to see

6
16:47:30,001 --> 16:47:33,625
So it's definitely sort of hard to pick this one out.

7
16:47:33,785 --> 16:47:42,754
So I have this high albedo spot that I'm looking for here.

8
16:47:42,794 --> 16:47:52,284
I don't have too much time, so it should be, I can see where, Teosca, is that what there?

9
16:47:52,565 --> 16:47:58,451
Okay, I can see the peak right next to it there, and I can see their bright spot now.

10
16:47:58,491 --> 16:47:59,552
I found that peak.

11
16:48:00,055 --> 16:48:06,704
I found that bright spot, so I'm going to zoom in and get some good images there of that area.

12
16:48:07,945 --> 16:48:14,234
Let's see how that, looking at that with the rest of the South Poleaitken Basin Aiken Basin area.

13
16:48:16,336 --> 16:48:21,383
And so, yeah, I can see exactly that crater with the peak ring.

14
16:48:25,128 --> 16:48:28,392
So I'm really looking to see if I can see that bright spot

15
16:48:28,810 --> 16:48:34,155
The brightness is not standing out as much as I would have expected right now.

16
16:48:37,399 --> 16:48:39,301
So that is sort of surprising.

17
16:48:39,321 --> 16:48:41,823
It's not surprising because it's right on the Terminator there.

18
16:48:42,584 --> 16:48:44,806
So that brightness didn't really help me find it.

19
16:48:44,907 --> 16:48:46,648
More of the morphology did.

20
16:48:48,090 --> 16:48:50,632
So making sure that I'm in the right spot.

21
16:48:51,974 --> 16:48:57,079
There's the two double right above it and then the mare.

22
16:48:57,548 --> 16:49:00,352
So I definitely got some images of that material there.

23
16:49:01,514 --> 16:49:04,518
But really cannot see any of those ejector rays.

24
16:49:05,419 --> 16:49:09,184
And looking for...

25
16:49:09,285 --> 16:49:14,091
There's definitely... Yeah, it's definitely slightly lighter.

26
16:49:15,373 --> 16:49:20,420
But really hard to just pick out much more of that texture of that small area besides like...

27
16:49:21,001 --> 16:49:23,124
Sort of looks like a dome-y material.

28
16:49:24,266 --> 16:49:27,370
Sort of raised a little bit.

29
16:49:28,227 --> 16:49:30,495
Slightly lighter than the area around it.

30
16:49:30,515 --> 16:49:33,525
Is that a volcano cone right there?

31
16:49:33,545 --> 16:49:35,773
Probably not, but pretty interesting.

### Transcript 044

1
16:52:00,031 --> 16:52:28,722
starting my Whole Moon target so this is our last Whole Moon looking at Whole Moon and SPA basin I'm gonna work on doing a mosaic here and so I'm gonna do north to south snake pattern starting at the disappearing limb at a mid a

2
16:52:28,769 --> 16:52:57,713
mid focal length so I'm gonna go at about 200 here it's gonna be my starting point so I'm gonna start right over at the limb uh near the north pole that's disappearing so I'm just gonna start my mosaic here just looking at all the the rays I can still see um and Jackson and Crookes Crater on my way down here all the way down to Apollo Basin as I go across I can see that

3
16:52:57,946 --> 16:53:03,735
Ray from Jackson's still really well in the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin area.

4
16:53:05,657 --> 16:53:07,901
I guess I'll try this methodology also.

5
16:53:07,921 --> 16:53:10,104
Oh, I moved.

6
16:53:10,384 --> 16:53:11,105
That was dumb.

7
16:53:12,187 --> 16:53:13,709
I'm gonna restart my mosaic.

8
16:53:14,410 --> 16:53:16,734
Gonna start again from the top.

9
16:53:16,754 --> 16:53:22,042
Because I moved mid-thing, so I wanted to make sure that you all can make this mosaic much better.

10
16:53:22,082 --> 16:53:24,966
So I'm gonna work on going through this again.

11
16:53:25,621 --> 16:53:28,225
Now back down to Apollo Basin.

12
16:53:29,587 --> 16:53:34,414
Going over, I can still see Apollo Basin as I work my way up.

13
16:53:35,075 --> 16:53:41,123
Still see the limb sort of on the, still within my frame here.

14
16:53:44,468 --> 16:53:45,790
Back up to the top.

15
16:53:46,951 --> 16:53:48,393
go work my way down.

16
16:53:48,573 --> 16:54:00,170
I'm really starting to see how these rays are over going the terrain behind it and also how a lot of these craters they don't look as sharp as I would have thought.

17
16:54:04,937 --> 16:54:15,692
So as I get closer to the Terminator that I am those morphologies is becoming much more

18
16:54:16,955 --> 16:54:20,901
Defined and just looking in all these different Mari patches.

19
16:54:20,921 --> 16:54:44,818
You see some of those wider streets especially between my engine I and looking up at Muscovy and I'm right in the middle of the NC working my way back down snaking around Tioskovsky with that big Mari pond Mari and I you can finally start to see those swirls better than I could see them in the first I

20
16:54:46,520 --> 16:54:55,592
First time around and then working my way back up.

21
16:54:55,812 --> 16:55:06,347
Hang on, come right back down on the Terminator.

22
16:55:07,568 --> 16:55:09,591
Get a little bit of Earth in my view.

23
16:55:19,038 --> 16:55:25,146
Alright, I finished that whole mosaic going through, so I'm actually pretty excited about that.

24
16:55:26,287 --> 16:55:34,277
I did, like I said before, I did restart it, but did pull it through, sort of seeing that transition between the different areas that I looked at.

25
16:55:36,199 --> 16:55:40,164
Yaskowski right there on that rim.

26
16:55:44,790 --> 16:55:47,273
Really incredible to be looking at the moon like that.

### Transcript 045

1
16:57:02,478 --> 16:57:07,343
starting target 20 with Aiken and some of the regional scarps.

2
16:57:08,224 --> 16:57:17,074
It took a few seconds to make sure I was located basically off of Mari Injanai, so thanks to the LTP for getting me there.

3
16:57:17,134 --> 16:57:26,203
Mari Injanai did allow me to trace up really quickly to Aiken's crater that really has one of the darkest Mari patches in my current view.

4
16:57:26,263 --> 16:57:28,806
Really amazing how that

5
16:57:29,242 --> 16:57:34,166
color changes as the spacecraft moves and the moon moves with us.

6
16:57:35,287 --> 16:57:42,193
But yeah, Aitken Crater is really showing some dark albedo in the base of it.

7
16:57:42,673 --> 16:57:50,260
There's one bright spot also in the base of Aitken Crater Crater that doesn't show up as bright in the LTP.

8
16:57:50,300 --> 16:57:53,403
So if I have time, I might do a quick annotation of that.

9
16:57:55,044 --> 16:57:58,607
For a quick note, it's the 400 millimeter

10
16:57:58,908 --> 16:58:04,959
image that's in the LTP is right above or right below the numeral 20.

11
16:58:05,841 --> 16:58:12,393
So it corresponds with that either central peak or central impact in Aiken Crater.

12
16:58:12,453 --> 16:58:19,667
That feature is a lot brighter by naked eye than it is in the image in the LTP.

13
16:58:20,423 --> 16:58:34,626
And also notably around Aiken Crater is like high albedo, slight rim highlights that go from about the 10 o'clock all the way around to the five o'clock.

14
16:58:35,307 --> 16:58:44,862
I don't see it at the other cardinal directions or clock directions, but I do see that highlighted rim with Aiken from that 10 to five o'clock.

15
16:58:45,719 --> 16:58:59,239
If I concentrate a little bit on the regional scarps that are northeast, I'm looking for any visibility of those and with the naked eye, I cannot pick anything up.

16
16:58:59,860 --> 16:59:09,174
Although I will kind of stare at that region, try to let my eyes adapt to the northeast again of Aiken Crater and see if any of those regional scarps pick up.

17
16:59:09,775 --> 16:59:13,380
I'll say broad terms with the naked eye, I haven't been able to.

18
16:59:14,086 --> 16:59:20,997
verify that anything I've seen is a scarp, nothing has stood out to me as like a, oh yeah, barely that is a scarp.

19
16:59:21,438 --> 16:59:31,294
But concentrating specifically in that northeast region of Dakin Crater that's highlighted by the LTP and not picking anything up there.

20
16:59:31,595 --> 16:59:39,908
So hopefully the camera does or hopefully that that tells you something about what our eyes can pick up and whatnot, what they can't.

21
16:59:41,491 --> 16:59:47,558
I'll do a quick check of LTP, make sure we've got all the observer actions covered.

22
16:59:50,842 --> 16:59:53,325
Swirls, so swirls in Aiken.

23
16:59:53,385 --> 16:59:59,353
Again, it's got that dark Mari Piatch at the bottom, but I don't see any swirls with the naked eye.

24
16:59:59,413 --> 17:00:03,838
So no swirls, no scarps by the naked eye on Aiken.

25
17:00:04,879 --> 17:00:07,262
And with that, I'll close out Target 20.

### Transcript 046

1
16:57:01,651 --> 16:57:05,295
Alright, starting on my next one, I finished that Whole Moon.

2
16:57:07,698 --> 16:57:20,133
I'm going to go to Aitken Crater Crater, and then what I'm going to be looking for here is the Compact Split Crater with Mare infill.

3
16:57:20,233 --> 16:57:27,962
So I'm looking to see if I can see any evidence of that scarp, the Raka X scarp.

4
16:57:28,634 --> 16:57:32,981
And so I want to get in the highest resolution that I can.

5
16:57:33,723 --> 16:57:38,410
So let me focus in on...

6
16:57:38,430 --> 16:57:40,454
There is Mari Injani.

7
16:57:49,489 --> 16:57:52,414
There's Mari Injani.

8
16:57:54,031 --> 16:58:20,646
there oh I can definitely see those swirls now and I work my way up to the mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater and I can really see that and so what I can see when I look in this mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater I can see that high point pretty in the center the rim of the crater is not very well defined

9
16:58:20,913 --> 16:58:23,296
but that mare pond is really well defined.

10
16:58:23,336 --> 16:58:28,663
And if I look in there, I can see some later sort of swirling also in there.

11
16:58:28,703 --> 16:58:33,869
There is the crater that is about the six o'clock position of that mare pond.

12
16:58:34,089 --> 16:58:38,995
And, um, and a little bit above that, it's almost like an upside down octopus.

13
16:58:39,516 --> 16:58:42,139
Uh, you can sort of see some of that coloring.

14
16:58:42,800 --> 16:58:47,005
It looks like the mare pond sort of flows around the

15
16:58:50,191 --> 16:58:58,819
It flows around the peak inside.

16
16:58:59,180 --> 16:59:00,721
Why can't I think of that word right now?

17
16:59:01,342 --> 16:59:05,326
And it has that little offshoot to the right from there.

18
16:59:06,066 --> 16:59:11,392
Okay, so I'm definitely going to go try to look for that scarp right now.

19
16:59:11,412 --> 16:59:16,857
I can see, almost looks like you can see those little swirls.

20
16:59:17,596 --> 16:59:20,460
Let me see if I can maybe draw those in a second too.

21
16:59:21,442 --> 16:59:25,528
But if I'm looking for that scarp, it is.

22
16:59:25,548 --> 16:59:37,926
It looks like that scarp is sort of bisecting the crater next to it.

23
16:59:37,946 --> 16:59:39,428
So I go there.

24
16:59:40,670 --> 16:59:46,438
I go across to this crater and see if I can

25
16:59:46,739 --> 16:59:48,321
Resolve that scarp.

26
16:59:48,981 --> 16:59:52,745
I think that is the one.

27
16:59:52,765 --> 16:59:53,706
There.

28
16:59:55,748 --> 16:59:56,729
Okay, again.

29
16:59:56,769 --> 17:00:00,313
It's very...

30
17:00:01,754 --> 17:00:03,716
I'm taking images of where it is.

31
17:00:03,736 --> 17:00:07,320
It's very hard for me to resolve that right now in the light.

32
17:00:08,041 --> 17:00:12,105
But I'm following the craters that it would be bisecting there.

33
17:00:13,638 --> 17:00:23,271
But it really isn't popping out as evident without like some of the shadows that would make it pop out a little bit more if it were closer to the Terminator than it actually is.

34
17:00:24,573 --> 17:00:29,019
And so I really can't see any of that tectonic activity there.

35
17:00:35,388 --> 17:00:41,316
But it is worth looking for and hopefully, I wish we could definitely have seen that for you all.

36
17:00:43,574 --> 17:00:45,568
Um, let's see.

### Transcript 047

1
17:03:03,052 --> 17:03:05,615
Target 21, Mari Injani, round two.

2
17:03:05,635 --> 17:03:14,786
I've allowed my eyes to adapt to that area after locating it with the LTP.

3
17:03:14,806 --> 17:03:17,729
Again, thanks for targeting me right in on Mari Injani.

4
17:03:17,749 --> 17:03:24,317
And I've got the 400 millimeter image up and trying to let my eyes adapt, but also looking down.

5
17:03:24,652 --> 17:03:29,958
quickly to where the swirls are in the image versus what I see with the naked eye.

6
17:03:30,619 --> 17:03:45,797
I can definitely see the swirl that kind of looks like a tadpole that's swimming from west to east into the southernmost crater that's circled by the green 21 on the lunar targeting package.

7
17:03:46,558 --> 17:03:50,963
I can pick that guy up as probably the most distinct by the naked eye.

8
17:03:51,415 --> 17:03:59,548
Um, it has a little bit of a muter tone, so a little bit grayer than the image on the LTP.

9
17:03:59,648 --> 17:04:16,174
Again, it depends, I guess, on the brightness of this, um, uh, PCD screen, but, uh, the, the, I wouldn't been able to say yay, verily that that is a swirl without knowing to look for it.

10
17:04:16,711 --> 17:04:28,172
Based off the image and the naked eye, but now that I know there's a swirl I could definitely pick it up and I can then translate that color that albedo up to

11
17:04:28,574 --> 17:04:38,531
the crater that's kind of to the north of the Mare Ingenii and Swirls area that's circled in that 400 millimeter lens image that's on the LTP.

12
17:04:38,771 --> 17:04:49,890
And I can pick out a patch of about three smaller swirls that are set pretty distinctly against that darker mare patch.

13
17:04:50,562 --> 17:04:58,775
And that's about it for swirls and Mare Ingenae is the large one to the south and the three that dot the northern crater.

14
17:05:00,297 --> 17:05:05,545
The basin overall from when I observed it before seems about the same type of topography.

15
17:05:06,347 --> 17:05:09,972
Maybe it's the illumination, maybe it's just the topography in that area.

16
17:05:10,854 --> 17:05:16,823
I don't see anything distinct on the crater walls or

17
17:05:17,647 --> 17:05:22,356
the base of that crater given the current illumination conditions.

18
17:05:23,097 --> 17:05:35,660
What I will say is when I look down at the image, 400 millimeter image on the LCP, I don't see that crater structure that is in the image in this illumination condition.

19
17:05:35,760 --> 17:05:41,190
Seems pretty flat right now, which is consistent with the other things along that same kind of

20
17:05:42,233 --> 17:05:44,836
semi-circular trace on the moon.

21
17:05:45,636 --> 17:05:49,661
You just don't see the topography that you do as it gets closer towards the Terminator.

22
17:05:52,043 --> 17:06:07,479
Overall, other distinct things around Mare Injani is a couple bright spots, maybe younger craters towards the rim of that northern Mare patch.

23
17:06:08,500 --> 17:06:11,903
I can definitely pick up that there's a brighter crater there

24
17:06:12,035 --> 17:06:15,438
I can trace back and locate in the LTP image.

25
17:06:15,718 --> 17:06:35,336
And so all those craters that are, I don't know what a good size reference are, but all those smaller craters that are in Mare Injani can barely pick up, but can certainly pick them up based on their albedo and some of the topography that's starting to show up.

26
17:06:35,376 --> 17:06:42,042
So even though the overall, I guess what I'm trying to say, even though the topography is pretty muted across there compared to the image,

27
17:06:42,410 --> 17:06:51,647
You can pick up the craters that are in that smaller diameter based on some of their color and albedo differences.

28
17:06:57,878 --> 17:07:03,068
I think that's all I'm going to be able to say on mare ingenii, but between

29
17:07:03,318 --> 17:07:11,009
The first and second observations of that, I think maybe it'd be interesting to go back and evaluate my first and second observations.

30
17:07:11,049 --> 17:07:22,384
I think the first time I had the camera and the second time was just by naked eye, so probably some things are a little bit distinct based on the observations between those two mediums.

31
17:07:23,266 --> 17:07:26,490
Okay, closing out Mare Injani, target 21 now.

### Transcript 048

1
17:03:02,275 --> 17:03:03,696
Okay, I'm back.

2
17:03:03,776 --> 17:03:04,918
I finished Aiken.

3
17:03:05,498 --> 17:03:12,305
Now I'm going to do, um, number, going to number 21, Amari Anjanine Swirls.

4
17:03:12,986 --> 17:03:14,727
Really excited about this one.

5
17:03:14,848 --> 17:03:24,017
I saw them peeking out a little bit before, um, when I was doing my Whole Moon Mosaic.

6
17:03:24,037 --> 17:03:24,878
And so I'm excited.

7
17:03:24,918 --> 17:03:28,401
I had looked at the Amari Anjanine Swirls during my first pass.

8
17:03:28,752 --> 17:03:35,800
And it was really tough to pull out those swirls, but as I'm zooming in now, I can definitely pull out those swirls.

9
17:03:37,001 --> 17:03:39,664
I can see a lot of those different S features.

10
17:03:39,704 --> 17:03:47,072
And so I'm using the camera fully zoomed in here, and it really does start to look like an eyeball to me.

11
17:03:47,773 --> 17:03:54,861
That Mari patch looks like the iris, and these swirls sort of look like the veins.

12
17:03:55,465 --> 17:03:57,928
I think you have that main mare patch.

13
17:03:57,948 --> 17:04:01,893
You've got some of the outbreaching from there.

14
17:04:01,913 --> 17:04:12,847
So those mare flows, they sort of lobate in the end on the right-hand side, and then the out channel on the left-hand side.

15
17:04:13,507 --> 17:04:19,735
And you can see how the mare material sort of disperses in through the crater basin.

16
17:04:20,440 --> 17:04:28,324
And then looking into those swirls themselves, they're definitely the ones sort of...

17
17:04:30,042 --> 17:04:38,750
So if I can look at that maripon and sort of go out from there, sort of like straight out to the left like the 9 o'clock, the swirls are much more faint.

18
17:04:39,691 --> 17:04:44,576
But as I go down towards like the 7 or 8 o'clock, they're much more defined.

19
17:04:45,156 --> 17:04:47,278
You get a couple of different shapes of the swirls.

20
17:04:47,378 --> 17:04:55,726
I sort of see things that look like sort of C shapes, some that look like backwards S's, some that are just like squiggle worms.

21
17:04:56,787 --> 17:04:59,830
It's pretty neat to be able to see that.

22
17:05:00,012 --> 17:05:03,655
I'm also looking at some of the textures that I see in the rim.

23
17:05:04,656 --> 17:05:07,479
I can see them on the wall there as well.

24
17:05:14,645 --> 17:05:18,889
So I just really, really need to see these.

25
17:05:19,809 --> 17:05:22,892
These swirls really are the best to find ones that we've seen.

26
17:05:23,613 --> 17:05:28,517
Like I've seen a couple other, can sort of see them in

27
17:05:30,168 --> 17:05:35,264
I could seal a couple and leave knits and I can get those sort of both in the same frame.

28
17:05:36,106 --> 17:05:44,211
Here I've got it centered between the two and like definitely comparing it up to see if I see any swirls in.

29
17:06:04,812 --> 17:06:11,241
Yeah, I really can't pick them out too much in Muscovy and say not like can MRI engine.

30
17:06:11,261 --> 17:06:33,250
I just absolutely incredible What I can see there Make sure that I mark that take a really good image, and I'll make sure I mark it with my With my indicator here, so I might get a good one with it right centered in the middle Okay, so I'm going in

31
17:06:33,584 --> 17:06:38,831
I can now see that in Mari Injani.

32
17:06:38,871 --> 17:06:41,815
Let's see if I was able to get that.

33
17:06:43,137 --> 17:06:44,138
Mari Injani.

34
17:06:44,218 --> 17:06:52,349
Mari Injani.

35
17:06:59,658 --> 17:07:03,203
Let me make sure that this is actually recording.

36
17:07:06,355 --> 17:07:07,516
Mari and Janai.

37
17:07:08,958 --> 17:07:11,360
All right, I was able to get the recording.

38
17:07:11,420 --> 17:07:13,162
I see my music note now.

39
17:07:16,746 --> 17:07:25,435
So what I can, one of the things that's really interesting to me is that I really couldn't tell those squirrels before and how this time around they're just so distinct.

40
17:07:26,256 --> 17:07:32,582
They're just popping out much better than they were able to be before.

41
17:07:32,917 --> 17:07:59,143
it's just looking at like how some of them really seem skinnier versus some of them have a thickness and the skinnier ones look like they have a much more defined um boundary but the ones that sort of like in the bottom like the one that sort of almost looks like a a worm with a giant head um there it just really looks

42
17:07:59,393 --> 17:08:04,681
like the the rounder part of the lighter color swirl is much more diffuse.

43
17:08:04,741 --> 17:08:17,359
And if you look at the bottom one there and then look inside the Mari patch itself it looks like there's some more of those little diffuse wispies that are not as defined as the swirls.

44
17:08:17,939 --> 17:08:28,995
So definitely it looks like there is like areas that mixture is happening in a lot of different places but not as defined in some and much more defined in others.

### Transcript 049

1
17:08:01,448 --> 17:08:03,431
All right, so I am getting ready.

2
17:08:03,451 --> 17:08:04,793
Now I am back.

3
17:08:05,174 --> 17:08:11,004
I am over in the, in window three that has CapCam 2.

4
17:08:11,444 --> 17:08:16,673
I'm now just focusing on my observations, not with the camera anymore.

5
17:08:17,334 --> 17:08:21,821
So it's so nice when you're able to zoom in so much.

6
17:08:21,921 --> 17:08:26,629
And now I'm back to looking at it as a whole and looking at the entire complete disk is still really

7
17:08:27,065 --> 17:08:28,146
really need to see.

8
17:08:28,447 --> 17:08:32,031
So I'm going to go and be looking for By's Ballot.

9
17:08:32,952 --> 17:08:35,315
It is up by Jackson Crater.

10
17:08:35,355 --> 17:08:40,721
So I can see Jackson there.

11
17:08:40,961 --> 17:08:45,206
I can see where Lacus Luxury region is.

12
17:08:45,607 --> 17:08:47,789
And so then I'm looking for that.

13
17:08:48,490 --> 17:08:51,033
I know it's a weird shaped.

14
17:08:52,374 --> 17:08:55,418
Lacus Luxury is that dark spot, which I can see.

15
17:08:55,752 --> 17:08:57,994
which really helps me find Bai's ballot.

16
17:08:59,155 --> 17:09:04,560
And so I have been able to find it.

17
17:09:05,281 --> 17:09:08,564
And so I'm just looking with my eyes right now out the window.

18
17:09:09,244 --> 17:09:24,358
And so I can see this in the, it's the rays of Jackson sort of go all the way from the limb almost over to essentially just above

19
17:09:24,760 --> 17:09:48,355
Bayes-Ballot region and so the Bayes-Ballot I think it's just like 72 kilometers in diameter so it's a pretty small guy but the shape of it is definitely weird and so I can tell that shape sort of using the brightness of the

20
17:09:49,162 --> 17:09:50,924
of the wall of that crater.

21
17:09:51,384 --> 17:09:56,009
And so the brightness is much stronger on the western side than the eastern.

22
17:09:56,069 --> 17:10:01,054
And then underneath we have the Lackus Luxury region, which is a darker spot.

23
17:10:01,114 --> 17:10:14,548
That dark spot sort of looks like the, you know, when we found the parachute on the surface of Mars from the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, you can sort of see all the strings that held the rover.

24
17:10:14,648 --> 17:10:16,350
That's exactly what it looks like.

25
17:10:16,955 --> 17:10:25,689
And so the darkness of that looks similar to what we can see over at Muscovy and say there.

26
17:10:26,510 --> 17:10:31,177
The boundaries of that, they definitely sort of streak and it's gradational.

27
17:10:31,197 --> 17:10:42,355
It's much stronger in the center of that lattice luxury, but we don't see anything sort of a emitter like

28
17:10:42,790 --> 17:10:47,239
Well, now that I've sort of acclimated a little bit, I can see sort of a gray or brownish.

29
17:10:47,299 --> 17:10:53,331
So on the bottom, that looks very similar to the highlands material that is being overlaid by the Jackson Crater rays.

30
17:10:54,152 --> 17:10:59,182
And so I don't see too much else in that structure there.

31
17:10:59,202 --> 17:11:01,727
And I'm running out of time because we had to switch.

32
17:11:01,747 --> 17:11:03,330
So I'll finish this one up.

### Transcript 050

1
17:13:00,790 --> 17:13:27,709
Okay, so I am now finished up on that gonna go back to Jackson Crater So I'm just looking at this I want to be able to annotate Well, I'm gonna work on an annotation during this one because I won't be able to annotate the extent of the ray system Including the furthest reaching areas of the rays And so I'm gonna work on opening up my OneNote

2
17:13:28,094 --> 17:13:32,539
I could definitely still see the brightness of Jackson and where it's rays are going.

3
17:13:33,020 --> 17:13:37,444
It's getting closer to the disappearing limb.

4
17:13:38,165 --> 17:13:50,219
It's probably about 200 or so, maybe a little less kilometers from the disappearing limb.

5
17:13:51,360 --> 17:13:57,527
And so I'm trying to look and I can see where these, let me open up my OneNote.

6
17:13:59,549 --> 17:14:02,933
Oh, already drawn things that I didn't need to draw yet.

7
17:14:05,536 --> 17:14:12,485
So I'm gonna try to draw what I can see from Jackson here.

8
17:14:12,525 --> 17:14:22,458
I'm going to use a... Get a good color going.

9
17:14:22,498 --> 17:14:25,962
I'm gonna use...

10
17:14:29,401 --> 17:14:59,003
Definitely like I'm gonna use sort of a Reddish pinkish color to sort of show my rays here And definitely try to make them a little bit thicker And so I can definitely tell that there is This one that goes around Aiken crater here

11
17:15:01,733 --> 17:15:05,737
So you can definitely see them sort of go past that.

12
17:15:09,881 --> 17:15:18,630
I can see them going almost to Mare Injani is sort of where the end of my rays are in that direction.

13
17:15:18,650 --> 17:15:25,457
I can still see that ray that goes all the way into like South Poleaitken Basin Aitken Crater Basin.

14
17:15:25,497 --> 17:15:27,138
That one is really sticking out.

15
17:15:27,559 --> 17:15:30,762
And then there's the one that goes just above

16
17:15:31,400 --> 17:15:46,120
The Lacus Luxury region that I was looking at before and then the one that goes a little bit over to the limb and I'm definitely drawing this in my OneNote so you can start to see these pretty well.

17
17:15:47,562 --> 17:15:58,977
It looks like they're still going over the bit from Crookes Crater and so you can really start to see it going off the edge and then that other crater right there whose Name I forget at this moment.

18
17:15:59,480 --> 17:16:10,472
It looks like the one that sort of goes around Aiken, it sort of spreads there and sort of goes all the way to, like sort of surround Mare Anjanai.

19
17:16:10,512 --> 17:16:18,861
Let me see if I can sort of show that a little bit with just sort of some lightness here.

20
17:16:20,683 --> 17:16:25,808
So I got some good annotations there that really show the extent that I can see

21
17:16:26,210 --> 17:16:28,533
Coming from that crater.

22
17:16:28,613 --> 17:16:55,727
It is so bright still that center is so is the brightest white thing that I can see Still on the moon, and so it's pretty neat to be looking at that Let me go quickly to my lunar geography review Trying to get the The far side get the Jackson and

23
17:16:56,298 --> 17:17:21,040
at them yeah that is definitely Crookes Crater right below it that I could still have in some really good rays that I can see as well so I'm gonna head back to make sure that I got everything that I need for my targeting plan and so yeah I can really start to see that like

24
17:17:21,560 --> 17:17:49,440
there it almost feels before as the brightness the first time I looked at this the albedo was some of the big um the albedo was much stronger and it's sort of uh disappearing those rays that like you can definitely still trace it into SBA but it would have been harder to trace than it was earlier um and so I can definitely see how uh as the

25
17:17:50,197 --> 17:17:55,983
as things approach the rays get closer to the Terminator it's much harder to see them now.

26
17:17:57,067 --> 17:17:59,498
So I will finish this one up.

### Transcript 051

1
17:18:01,921 --> 17:18:05,385
Okay, starting target 25 Jules Verne crater.

2
17:18:05,826 --> 17:18:08,489
I'm just kind of centered up on that.

3
17:18:09,370 --> 17:18:14,557
Oh, there's a few minute break between 24 and 25.

4
17:18:14,937 --> 17:18:20,284
So it looks like I got a little extra time on Jules Verne.

5
17:18:20,565 --> 17:18:23,248
So going to go ahead and capture this one right.

6
17:18:23,608 --> 17:18:27,894
The LTP has like a five minute break between 23 and 25.

7
17:18:28,495 --> 17:18:30,477
So it seems like we're missing 24.

8
17:18:34,777 --> 17:18:36,920
And so hopefully the LTP is right.

9
17:18:37,000 --> 17:18:39,504
I'm going to keep going with 25 with Jules Verne.

10
17:18:42,848 --> 17:18:47,795
Give me one second to get right back onto the target list.

11
17:18:47,835 --> 17:18:52,642
So looking for centered photographs at the highest focal length of Jules.

12
17:18:53,163 --> 17:18:59,492
And I've got pretty good eyes on it, was able to index off of Silkowski pretty easily.

13
17:18:59,512 --> 17:19:03,838
And so we're going to go ahead and start shooting some photos.

14
17:19:05,303 --> 17:19:14,957
that includes Tsiolkovsky, so you can also index off of it just like I did towards Jules.

15
17:19:18,963 --> 17:19:25,172
Overall, Jules is starting to become highlighted by that illumination of the Terminator.

16
17:19:26,073 --> 17:19:34,686
Topography is really starting to pop, especially to the north of it at 10 to two o'clock.

17
17:19:35,493 --> 17:19:39,098
There's a central little mare patch there.

18
17:19:39,158 --> 17:19:53,818
It's like the size of a cashew nut that starts to really stick out, distinct in its albedo.

19
17:19:56,342 --> 17:20:04,032
One of the things that just my eye keeps getting drawn to is that central peak of Silkoski, so trying to capture a few images of that while I can.

20
17:20:04,400 --> 17:20:07,153
just because it's so dramatic on the limb.

21
17:20:36,293 --> 17:20:47,812
Just taking a quick look back to make sure that everything's set up for this final little stretch and try not to miss Muscovian base and a high priority target coming up.

22
17:20:49,975 --> 17:20:59,871
Really one of the things that stuck out to me on Jules Verne is that distinct topography that's starting to pop in the illumination conditions.

23
17:21:17,738 --> 17:21:28,391
I've got plenty of photos that are at the highest resolution or highest zoom of the lens, 400 millimeters.

24
17:21:29,292 --> 17:21:33,817
A couple different orientations to try to capture that topography.

25
17:21:36,841 --> 17:21:40,925
My eye does pick up on the mare patch a little bit better.

26
17:21:40,946 --> 17:21:47,273
When I look above the camera, I can see that mare patch, that little cashew nut shape

27
17:21:47,658 --> 17:21:50,762
a little bit better than what I see through the window and through the lens.

28
17:21:51,644 --> 17:21:56,611
So just a note there that my eye is actually picking up that distinct color.

29
17:21:56,791 --> 17:22:05,363
I'm sure once you stretch these pictures a little bit, they'll be better than what my eye is seeing through the viewfinder.

30
17:22:08,507 --> 17:22:09,649
Okay, I'm gonna call that.

31
17:22:10,034 --> 17:22:18,155
good with Jules Verne target number 25 because I know my next high priority is 26 with Muscovian Basins, a high priority target for you guys.

32
17:22:19,077 --> 17:22:22,305
So closing out Jules Verne 25 now.

### Transcript 052

1
17:20:00,993 --> 17:20:03,276
Okay, so now I had finished.

2
17:20:03,937 --> 17:20:06,982
I am starting number 25, Jewel's Fern.

3
17:20:07,022 --> 17:20:23,187
So I'm looking for Jewel's Fern over between Tioskovsky and to the west of Mari Injani.

4
17:20:23,207 --> 17:20:25,049
So I can definitely see this.

5
17:20:25,230 --> 17:20:28,114
This is the one with the C-shaped Mari patch.

6
17:20:28,533 --> 17:20:32,739
in the center of it just west of Mare Injani.

7
17:20:33,060 --> 17:20:44,237
And so I'm about, let's see, about 200, 250 kilometers from the Terminator on the left.

8
17:20:46,680 --> 17:20:49,104
That's where I am too.

9
17:20:51,347 --> 17:20:54,372
And so I can definitely see that.

10
17:20:58,604 --> 17:21:03,671
And so I can tell there.

11
17:21:03,751 --> 17:21:09,259
And so what I really want to do is sort of look for any history of fractures.

12
17:21:09,400 --> 17:21:14,307
And so they have potentially some four fractured critters in here.

13
17:21:14,487 --> 17:21:18,853
I can't really see any of these fractures.

14
17:21:19,053 --> 17:21:27,586
I can tell from my LTP, they're sort of along the edge of that C. But from this view right here, I can't resolve those.

15
17:21:27,666 --> 17:21:28,527
Really, it's the

16
17:21:29,182 --> 17:21:33,506
the dark mare patches that are much easier to see.

17
17:21:34,527 --> 17:21:41,973
That C shape looks so much more distinct right now than it actually does in my...

18
17:21:45,256 --> 17:21:58,868
I can sort of see some of those raised rims in there, but as we're getting closer, the small craters that are around Jules Verne are becoming much more defined with their limbs, their rims,

19
17:21:59,236 --> 17:22:04,303
It's definitely sort of, you can see the morphology starting to come back.

20
17:22:04,804 --> 17:22:08,709
The Jules Verne crater is circular, is mostly circular in shape.

21
17:22:10,451 --> 17:22:19,364
The mare sort of has that sharper boundary, especially on the bottom, the bottom part of the outside of the sea.

22
17:22:19,444 --> 17:22:21,126
But as you go up towards the top,

23
17:22:21,578 --> 17:22:32,728
especially right where that crater is, like around the 11 o'clock and the boundary of the Jules Verne, you really start to lose that distinct boundary of that mare patch.

24
17:22:33,489 --> 17:22:42,176
The gray inside is sort of the lighter, is a bit of a lighter gray up top and that darker gray the bottom.

25
17:22:42,236 --> 17:22:50,944
That two-tone is very similar to what I can see on Muscovy and say with that lighter tone on the bottom and that darker tone on top.

26
17:22:53,017 --> 17:23:19,817
the the shadows are starting to show up especially there's that brighter spot just north of like about the 10 30 position um and so i can start to see that that part oh this part of the moon's falling down um and start to see that bright area along the top very high

27
17:23:20,337 --> 17:23:27,506
Bright albedo and so you can start to see that a little bit of that Rim brightness.

28
17:23:27,586 --> 17:23:50,293
I really can't pull out too much of the texture that is in there from this perspective But it is Just Is my timeline

29
17:23:54,256 --> 17:23:56,438
Looks like I actually was a little bit ahead.

30
17:23:56,678 --> 17:23:57,379
That's okay.

31
17:23:58,720 --> 17:24:01,123
I'm still looking at the Jules Verne right there.

32
17:24:01,823 --> 17:24:07,969
Um, and one of the things it's like those sort of brighter areas as you go around.

33
17:24:08,029 --> 17:24:11,513
Do you see one like to the north?

34
17:24:12,334 --> 17:24:13,735
You definitely see it.

35
17:24:14,936 --> 17:24:19,180
If I go to my OneNote here for my Jules Verne.

36
17:24:19,401 --> 17:24:20,922
Oh, made a line.

37
17:24:22,302 --> 17:24:24,545
I see the like one bright zone.

38
17:24:24,886 --> 17:24:26,889
I'm going to draw it in here on my page.

39
17:24:27,470 --> 17:24:36,604
I see the one bright zone below, but the area that's a little bit brighter above it doesn't really show up as much in my LTP.

40
17:24:36,624 --> 17:24:39,588
And so it's like just around these two craters.

41
17:24:39,969 --> 17:24:41,671
I've sort of highlighted them.

42
17:24:41,732 --> 17:24:45,998
It looks like a little beret on top of my crater right now.

43
17:24:46,535 --> 17:24:49,298
Um, and so I can see where that brightness is.

44
17:24:49,378 --> 17:25:01,809
It's almost like I can follow that brightness around sort of like, you know, when you sweat and like the saltiness sort of makes the sweat stains that stay on like your workout clothes or like a swimsuit.

45
17:25:02,310 --> 17:25:05,353
That is sort of how like sort of these bright patches look.

46
17:25:05,393 --> 17:25:13,420
They're like very granular, um, sort of raising up a little bit, but very delicate on top.

47
17:25:13,906 --> 17:25:26,638
um sort of these white braids almost look like white veins going around um the moon.

48
17:25:26,658 --> 17:25:40,572
Um let's see it's really hard to see any slopes in there and um I think that's pretty good for my jewel's fern.

49
17:25:40,906 --> 17:25:46,191
Just really neat looking at the moon this way after like looking at it so close up with my camera.

50
17:25:46,311 --> 17:25:54,678
So taking this step back again and looking at it from a distance and comparing the areas to each other in one full swoop.

51
17:25:54,738 --> 17:25:57,781
This really is a really neat view to be able to see.

52
17:25:57,841 --> 17:26:06,069
Especially like looking over and like as South Polacan Basin is sort of disappearing off the limb.

53
17:26:06,149 --> 17:26:10,913
That's sort of like the yellowish tint that's like around

54
17:26:11,737 --> 17:26:12,918
Apollo Basin.

55
17:26:13,059 --> 17:26:15,221
It's sort of like a very light yellow.

56
17:26:16,122 --> 17:26:24,432
That's really neat to sort of see that bit of color over there against the stark grayness that is along the Terminator.

57
17:26:25,713 --> 17:26:39,769
That I'm pretty, pretty impressed with as I start to go through and look at these and watching Jackson and these really high albedo rays start to disappear as well.

58
17:26:40,390 --> 17:26:50,603
It's pretty incredible to have gone from when we first started looking at this we had that full disc and now we're just looking at a section of the moon and it's pretty neat.

### Transcript 053

1
17:26:03,608 --> 17:26:07,794
All right, starting high priority target number 26, Muscovians Basin.

2
17:26:09,096 --> 17:26:14,643
Specifically going to center some images and capture that entire basin.

3
17:26:14,703 --> 17:26:16,846
Might make it a few little mosaics of it.

4
17:26:17,367 --> 17:26:20,952
It's really starting to pop now as it comes closer to the Terminator.

5
17:26:21,032 --> 17:26:24,697
So this is great lighting conditions to capture it.

6
17:26:25,458 --> 17:26:33,109
Definitely can give you guys some words on the structure, texture, and variations of any color and albedo.

7
17:26:33,562 --> 17:26:37,406
And I'm going to keep a close eye out for lava flows.

8
17:26:38,047 --> 17:26:40,269
The basin rim right now is really starting to pop.

9
17:26:40,289 --> 17:26:44,433
So hopefully those come across in the images and any swirls.

10
17:26:44,734 --> 17:26:49,999
So lots to look at for, lots to look out for in Muscovian basin.

11
17:26:50,600 --> 17:26:56,446
And I'll double check that I've captured any notes after I start shooting some pictures here.

12
17:26:56,486 --> 17:27:02,472
So I might go quiet for a little bit as I capture some Muscovians.

13
17:27:03,717 --> 17:27:04,899
glamour shots here.

14
17:27:16,857 --> 17:27:27,293
Okay, at the highest resolution, so at 400, I can capture all of Muscovian's ring structure with a little bit of the Terminator in there.

15
17:27:27,313 --> 17:27:31,800
And so I'm gonna capture a couple photos

16
17:27:36,050 --> 17:27:52,432
a couple 20 or so in different orientations, different things in the frame of the photo for context.

17
17:27:52,572 --> 17:28:01,804
So a couple with the limb in there or with the Terminator, sorry, in there and a couple with the limb in there.

18
17:28:03,995 --> 17:28:05,897
Again, all at 400 millimeters.

19
17:28:07,359 --> 17:28:09,062
Now I'm gonna do a quick little mosaic.

20
17:28:13,708 --> 17:28:15,590
About 75% overlap.

21
17:28:26,884 --> 17:28:29,648
Realizing I'm doing an east-west snake.

22
17:28:30,860 --> 17:28:36,526
Probably should have done a north-south one given the Terminator conditions right now, but shouldn't matter too much.

23
17:28:38,729 --> 17:28:49,160
Okay, so there's a mosaic in there at 400 millimeter, that east-west snake across Muscovians, a tier of three from north to south.

24
17:28:55,167 --> 17:28:59,972
Again, using the camera lens kind of as a binocular now, or a monocular,

25
17:29:00,880 --> 17:29:13,894
I can maybe see some really nice terminations of the mare, you know, the lava coming up against some of the rim structure to the west side of Muscovians.

26
17:29:16,156 --> 17:29:21,321
Specifically, starting around the one o'clock to four o'clock.

27
17:29:22,242 --> 17:29:24,264
Seems like it comes the closest to the rim there.

28
17:29:24,304 --> 17:29:29,790
Take a few more photos.

29
17:29:38,410 --> 17:29:48,383
Really concentrating on trying to keep the camera steady, take out any shakes and not cram the camera too much into the window while I'm doing this.

30
17:29:52,068 --> 17:30:02,702
Albedo wise, the highest albedo is right at the crater rim at the, I'll say 1030.

31
17:30:04,564 --> 17:30:07,708
Between 10 and 11 o'clock is the highest albedo on the crater rim.

32
17:30:08,178 --> 17:30:14,825
The darkest albedo is at the base of the crater about one o'clock.

33
17:30:14,865 --> 17:30:25,015
There's a crater down there that's at two o'clock that's right around there seems to be the darkest part of that mare patch.

34
17:30:25,936 --> 17:30:28,719
Everything else is a couple of tones of gray in between.

35
17:30:28,759 --> 17:30:36,987
Didn't see any distinct colors other than shades of gray at this time.

36
17:30:37,692 --> 17:30:42,299
I'm taking a quick look at the LTP and allow my eyes to adjust back inside of the cabinet.

37
17:30:43,541 --> 17:30:56,239
So I definitely got a good centered images, captured the entire basin, captured the basin with some different things in context, and also a small little mosaic there.

38
17:30:57,581 --> 17:31:04,071
I'm not going to make any annotation here because I didn't see any

39
17:31:04,388 --> 17:31:09,338
strong color difference and I hopefully described the albedo context best I could.

40
17:31:10,380 --> 17:31:16,433
But I want to keep my hands on the camera here and get on to the next image and close out strong.

41
17:31:17,435 --> 17:31:20,541
So that's it for target number 26.

### Transcript 054

1
17:27:00,807 --> 17:27:30,072
Okay, this is back to Marie going to our high priority target of Muscovy and Sea Basin This is gonna be I think one of our last Last targets we're getting close to the end of our time together me and my Pelotor headset and so I'm really excited to I've been using Muscovy and Sea as a Definitely one of those anchor points like you can tell why it's one of our 15 this whole entire time

2
17:27:30,355 --> 17:27:34,140
It's probably been my best scale bar throughout the entire day.

3
17:27:34,681 --> 17:27:50,623
Just that distinct mare patch really is covers, you know, like four, four and a half, one, two, three, four and a half of them really cover the width that I can see in that line of the moon right now.

4
17:27:51,364 --> 17:27:57,612
And so that's been pretty neat to use that as my scale bar throughout the day.

5
17:27:58,435 --> 17:28:18,298
I am going to look at this and sort of one of my goals is to look for color and albedo effects within that mare patch and really look to see if I can see any of those swirls very similarly to what I was looking at in like mare and janai.

6
17:28:18,838 --> 17:28:27,548
And when I first look at it here I can start to see now that I've been staring at just it again for a while I can start to see

7
17:28:28,439 --> 17:28:32,905
that sort of two-tone tie-dye-ness within that mare patch.

8
17:28:33,866 --> 17:28:37,271
And again, I'm looking at this with just my eyes, not my camera.

9
17:28:37,711 --> 17:28:50,608
It's a very circular basin, and that mare patch within it is very well constrained on one side by the raised rim feature, the raised inner peak ring.

10
17:28:51,069 --> 17:28:55,915
And then you sort of see how the mare flows outward from there.

11
17:28:56,738 --> 17:29:02,585
And so it sort of looks like that breach that is going outward.

12
17:29:02,645 --> 17:29:06,149
And it doesn't make it all the way to the outer basin rim.

13
17:29:07,651 --> 17:29:09,994
And so it sort of stops a little bit short of it.

14
17:29:11,175 --> 17:29:14,900
It looks like it's sort of got that low bait sort of boundary to it.

15
17:29:15,240 --> 17:29:17,343
And it is a bit of that.

16
17:29:18,705 --> 17:29:24,872
And so it just looks like it sort of disperses into the rest of the basin.

17
17:29:27,046 --> 17:29:32,674
I'm going to sort of try to work on my one note here.

18
17:29:32,774 --> 17:29:42,327
So I've got that zoomed in and looking to see if I can draw out some of these differences that I can see in the colors.

19
17:29:42,367 --> 17:29:43,388
Let me get a good...

20
17:29:45,691 --> 17:29:48,295
I'm gonna see if I can use maybe this

21
17:29:53,928 --> 17:30:21,977
see if I can use my highlighter to really help here it's really that inner part that you really can't see that highlighter at all so let me let me undo that highlighter let me try again with something different I want to use a pen I think it just sort of like a lighter blue is gonna help me here these are the lighter areas and so I can really tell this center spot

22
17:30:22,582 --> 17:30:47,745
I need to zoom in a little bit so I'm trying to not let the not let it bias me too much here so I can really see this like this lighter part out here and then there is another later part coming out from

23
17:30:48,485 --> 17:31:10,476
around this like between these two craters that I am drawing and then I can sort of get that low bait sort of feature as it goes into that other what I know to be that like floor fracture craters I can't really see those fractures here at the resolution that I am looking for

24
17:31:10,760 --> 17:31:14,386
It's definitely a little bit of just sort of like that tie-dye.

25
17:31:14,406 --> 17:31:28,227
It almost does look like those swirls slightly when you start to look, especially this one line that is above the crater that you can see around the one o'clock, like one to two o'clock part of that basin.

26
17:31:28,268 --> 17:31:30,170
You can start to see a little bit of line.

27
17:31:30,191 --> 17:31:33,055
The longer I look at this, the more I convince that I see

28
17:31:33,575 --> 17:31:37,101
see more pieces of that light and darkness.

29
17:31:37,181 --> 17:31:47,397
It's really not as defined as you could see in Mare Ingenii, but sort of similar to how there were those sort of wispiness that you could see during parts of Mare Ingenii.

30
17:31:47,417 --> 17:31:50,922
It's sort of very similar to what I am seeing here as well.

31
17:31:53,065 --> 17:31:54,047
And I

32
17:31:55,343 --> 17:32:07,547
The morphology that I can see here is that I can see these two craters that are about the 10 o'clock and the 8 o'clock position and then the one that's about the 7 o'clock and the 6 o'clock

33
17:32:08,017 --> 17:32:10,762
There's a really bright spot in the rim.

34
17:32:11,563 --> 17:32:15,289
I'm gonna draw in with like a different color here.

35
17:32:17,773 --> 17:32:21,700
It's like a pinkish color that's like a really high albedo spot.

36
17:32:22,942 --> 17:32:25,926
That's really up by this one crater here.

37
17:32:26,007 --> 17:32:30,254
Let me see if I can see exactly where it is.

38
17:32:30,915 --> 17:32:32,337
That's that rim.

39
17:32:32,975 --> 17:32:40,343
It's like in this area, I'm surrounding it by pink, definitely some higher albedo, small impacts right there.

40
17:32:44,287 --> 17:32:45,468
Let's see how I'm doing.

41
17:32:46,189 --> 17:32:51,494
I definitely still got another minute or so on my timing.

42
17:32:53,256 --> 17:33:02,205
Just that, just knowing the power that it would take that lava flow prize, just really neat.

43
17:33:02,793 --> 17:33:04,980
I'm gonna try to finish this one up.

44
17:33:06,084 --> 17:33:08,030
It's been fun for looking for targets.

45
17:33:08,170 --> 17:33:12,364
I'm just gonna probably just talk your ear off as I look for Impact Flashes.

### Transcript 055

1
17:28:03,710 --> 17:28:06,174
All right, I'm still in window two.

2
17:28:06,214 --> 17:28:19,192
I'm using the camera to look for Impact Flashes, but while I do that, I'm gonna capture a full frame of the moon when this dramatic, like, half-Terminator thing creeping across the moon.

3
17:28:19,252 --> 17:28:25,381
I'm gonna use the camera to keep an eye out for Impact Flashes.

4
17:28:25,441 --> 17:28:29,567
Whoop, I just saw something in a wiggly line through the camera.

5
17:28:29,587 --> 17:28:32,451
I wasn't holding down the,

6
17:28:34,017 --> 17:28:40,846
the shutter at the time, but I saw a squiggly green line fly across the Terminator of the moon.

7
17:28:41,047 --> 17:28:49,098
It definitely wasn't a point function, but it was a, maybe I saw kind of a streak, possible impact flash.

8
17:28:49,178 --> 17:28:50,660
If it was, it was bright green.

9
17:28:51,001 --> 17:28:56,488
It was in the northern third of the dark Terminator area.

10
17:28:57,530 --> 17:29:02,877
Trying to take some pictures there, but I'll try to go ahead and annotate what I saw.

11
17:29:06,603 --> 17:29:10,091
after taking a few more photos and then I'll get back to making observations.

12
17:29:12,177 --> 17:29:24,747
So look out for a one note annotation from my observations of a green impact possible flash in the early parts of observing the target 27.

### Transcript 056

1
17:33:04,064 --> 17:33:09,451
Okay, I went ahead and annotated my first impact flash observation.

2
17:33:12,114 --> 17:33:15,037
Back at the camera, back out looking at the window.

3
17:33:15,057 --> 17:33:24,609
Gonna try to take a photo every 30 seconds or so as this Terminator slowly walks across while also looking through the viewfinder.

4
17:33:24,649 --> 17:33:31,017
Using the camera as kind of monocular to look for Impact Flashes.

5
17:33:33,494 --> 17:33:44,274
while also capturing a nice time sequence at the same lens zoom.

6
17:33:45,717 --> 17:33:55,215
I'm not going to change that at all, just going to capture the whole field of view of the moon from north to south and watch that Terminator just cross

7
17:34:08,105 --> 17:34:18,558
Still really impressed by that crater with the central peak in it, Tsiolkovsky, I think, and it's really just going into the Terminator now.

8
17:34:18,578 --> 17:34:31,253
It's amazing how you can see that rim highlighted, but the darkness of the Terminator just to the west of it.

9
17:34:32,875 --> 17:34:37,521
Central peak is still really popping out, but also trying to train my eye towards the

10
17:34:38,497 --> 17:34:45,406
the part of the moon that's in the Terminator, making sure that I don't miss any impact flash again.

11
17:34:46,407 --> 17:34:50,152
That last one was just this bright green streak that kind of did this Z shape.

12
17:34:51,254 --> 17:34:59,104
Tried best to capture it in the annotation using the appropriate color pen that I could get close to that bright green.

13
17:35:00,786 --> 17:35:03,930
Didn't do it justice, but it definitely was not a point source.

14
17:35:07,538 --> 17:35:09,961
more of a streak, so not sure how to explain that one.

15
17:35:09,981 --> 17:35:36,297
I think for file size reasons I'm going to go ahead and end this audio file.

16
17:35:36,884 --> 17:35:46,219
and continue to observe in this manner, but let you know if I do see any other Impact Flashes during the remainder of the time that we have here on target 27.

### Transcript 057

1
17:42:03,254 --> 17:42:04,936
All right, back with you on target 27.

2
17:42:05,136 --> 17:42:21,353
I've been probably spent about 80% of the time observing the moon through the camera lens at 90 on the zoom.

3
17:42:22,494 --> 17:42:25,177
It captures the extent from north to south.

4
17:42:25,698 --> 17:42:32,485
I've had the red center target right at the Terminator and been capturing photos every

5
17:42:33,140 --> 17:42:43,914
three to five seconds to make sure that I capture that transition that's happening right on the Terminator while also keeping an eye out through the lens for any Impact Flashes.

6
17:42:45,436 --> 17:42:53,947
While I'm doing that, the other 20% of the time has been looking down at the PCD and making annotations or saving off audio files.

7
17:42:55,308 --> 17:43:02,117
Gonna go ahead and stick with this audio recording through the last few minutes we have here on

8
17:43:03,008 --> 17:43:05,831
Target 27 for looking for these Impact Flashes.

9
17:43:06,972 --> 17:43:08,654
Pretty jazzed that I did see one.

10
17:43:09,635 --> 17:43:14,901
Pretty confused by its color and its characteristics.

11
17:43:15,521 --> 17:43:20,066
But hopefully we captured some of that in the saw imagery.

12
17:43:22,389 --> 17:43:26,894
And hopefully I annotated that pretty well to at least capture what I saw.

13
17:43:27,835 --> 17:43:32,880
I'll be interested in, after we do the debrief, whether Marie saw the same thing.

14
17:43:36,691 --> 17:43:42,498
Hopefully these series of photos every three to five seconds as the Terminator is changing are helpful.

15
17:43:43,419 --> 17:43:58,378
I find it useful to not only use the camera as a optical device to look for the Impact Flashes, but also just watch that Terminator change and one to capture it for you guys as well.

16
17:44:04,855 --> 17:44:21,076
If I would have thought about it before I got set up for this, I might have pulled out the bracket and got the camera set up so that I could go hands free and maybe even set the camera up so that it would take photos automatically at a set time.

17
17:44:21,997 --> 17:44:34,052
Would have made a really cool video out of this if it was, if we weren't, if we didn't jostle the camera between that whole time sequence during this 10 minutes.

18
17:44:34,623 --> 17:44:43,922
But I think that way I could have looked for Impact Flashes, but also captured this really cool time sequence that I'm trying the best that I can by hand.

19
17:44:43,942 --> 17:44:48,632
But if I would have had the bracket set up, might've been a better sequence.

20
17:45:25,062 --> 17:45:33,930
It's really cool to see some of these basins start to disappear into the Terminator and how they really pop right before they just go black.

21
17:45:41,376 --> 17:45:43,878
Really missing seeing the Earth out of the window, that was pretty cool.

22
17:45:46,981 --> 17:45:54,107
Some of those images of that blue Earth are just still going to resonate with me for the rest of my life.

23
17:46:07,283 --> 17:46:22,029
And I see we're coming to the end of the impact flash observation, so I'm going to go ahead and end the audio here, stop the sequence of images that I've been taking every three to five seconds, and see whatever get-aheads that we have while we still have this beautiful view.

24
17:46:23,612 --> 17:46:25,495
So, finishing target 27 now.

### Transcript 058

1
17:42:00,031 --> 17:42:27,523
next I'm gonna look for some Impact Flashes myself just gonna stare at the moon for a bit it's really just embracing these last moments while I'm looking for waiting for these last moments well before they turn the attitude away I know that we're just gonna be able to so I'm really focusing on the part to the west of the Terminator that is in darkness

2
17:42:28,668 --> 17:42:31,912
Because I know that's probably where we'd best be able to see it.

3
17:42:32,012 --> 17:42:33,594
And I hope that we can find one.

4
17:42:33,634 --> 17:42:41,244
It seems like Trevor saw something, but I was too busy trying to write my Name in the audio recording.

5
17:42:41,805 --> 17:42:43,307
So I think I missed it.

6
17:42:43,427 --> 17:42:47,892
But hopefully he had a really good observation there as well.

7
17:42:47,932 --> 17:42:55,502
While he starts annotating that, I'm just going to keep my eyes peeled, keep looking for it as much as I want to.

8
17:42:55,921 --> 17:43:15,525
continue just looking at the moon I'm really trying to just keep my eyes where there's darkness what a cool day just flew around the moon today how many people get to do that?

9
17:43:16,046 --> 17:43:25,017
not that many we've trained for so long and so much stuff on this mission and

10
17:43:25,148 --> 17:43:25,809
Here we are.

11
17:43:26,029 --> 17:43:30,916
We're heading around and we're going to start coming back towards home.

12
17:43:31,357 --> 17:43:38,547
Well, we are coming back towards home, but we are just making our way back now.

13
17:43:41,251 --> 17:43:47,821
And I can imagine the excitement that's going on down there in the sur of all of these recordings.

14
17:43:48,021 --> 17:43:51,766
I can't wait to get them on the ground and get these images on the ground.

15
17:43:51,867 --> 17:43:54,210
I know we saw some really cool stuff today.

16
17:43:54,764 --> 17:44:20,822
and just absolutely incredible I almost feel like right now I'm leaving somebody a voicemail and it's just sitting in their pocket and I'm waiting to see if they're home but I'll keep talking to you in case that I hear something else a solid 10 minutes of my voice as I just watch for things

17
17:44:34,454 --> 17:44:48,249
I think one of my favorite parts of the day was just at this one point, you know, Angela got a bungee cord wrapped completely around her ankle and definitely we had to untangle her as we did our switching.

18
17:44:49,471 --> 17:44:59,462
I'm definitely thankful right now that I ate a snack in between, but I know that we're all gonna sit down and have some really cool dinner conversation tonight.

19
17:45:01,344 --> 17:45:03,246
Talking about all the things we saw.

20
17:45:04,323 --> 17:45:32,423
I think some of my favorite parts were just especially some of these targets we got to do twice and like the differences between how hard I looked for how hard I looked for swirls at the beginning versus how easy it was to find them later is just really incredible and knowing that we were able to do that over the course of one flyby when it would take so long for other

21
17:45:32,842 --> 17:45:34,704
sources to be able to do that.

22
17:45:36,346 --> 17:45:58,174
Just seeing how things go from no morphology to this very distinct Terminator that we have with all of the morphology, the puckering of the surface, knowing that every single one of those impacts were made by a flash that I am waiting for right now.

23
17:45:58,913 --> 17:46:03,118
But I'll probably never see it and that's okay because they don't come around that much.

24
17:46:04,540 --> 17:46:06,562
And at least Trevor saw one.

25
17:46:09,826 --> 17:46:11,949
That's absolutely so neat.

26
17:46:11,969 --> 17:46:15,012
There's such that one little bright thing over by leafnets.

27
17:46:15,092 --> 17:46:16,614
That's a really bright spot.

28
17:46:17,255 --> 17:46:20,719
I'm sure that got captured earlier but it really hits out.

29
17:46:21,172 --> 17:46:25,538
And there's this one little bright spot that's sort of off the edge of the Terminator.

30
17:46:25,558 --> 17:46:29,544
It's like, I can tell it's like a central peak or something like that.

31
17:46:29,624 --> 17:46:40,621
It just looks like it's this one little spot, this high point that's still getting the littlest bit of sunlight right now, but it looks like it's its own little, little ocean.

32
17:46:40,681 --> 17:46:42,083
I wonder if I can draw that.

33
17:46:42,103 --> 17:46:43,365
I shouldn't draw that somewhere.

34
17:46:43,385 --> 17:46:44,667
It's like right in the middle.

35
17:46:44,727 --> 17:46:50,976
You can see, you can see,

36
17:46:51,783 --> 17:46:54,986
There's that big crater that's below.

37
17:46:55,307 --> 17:46:56,328
Let's go in and see.

38
17:46:57,829 --> 17:46:58,650
Kohlschlatter.

39
17:47:00,272 --> 17:47:13,645
Around Kohlschlatter, towards the bottom rim of Kohlschlatter and over, right over the terminators where I see that bright spot that's got that high point that's probably a central peak.

40
17:47:15,527 --> 17:47:20,372
So that's really cool to be able to see that as well.

41
17:47:21,297 --> 17:47:24,483
I actually really like impact crater time.

42
17:47:25,826 --> 17:47:28,531
Just looking, waiting to see if something appears.

43
17:47:29,433 --> 17:47:35,244
I can hear still the shutter of Trevor's camera just constantly going.

44
17:47:35,645 --> 17:47:39,252
And so I think he's hoping that he would at least catch something else.

45
17:47:39,392 --> 17:47:42,057
But I know our SAW cameras are doing their jobs.

46
17:47:42,762 --> 17:48:12,769
and uh at this point they're streaming all of this back to you so if you they'll catch it in there i just wanna i want to see it first though trevor already saw it first so i want to see it second right there when there are viruses in space there's viruses on trevor's pcd oh no

47
17:48:15,652 --> 17:48:23,981
Wow you can really start to, you can still see that light yellow goldish in the SPA basin as I stand here.

48
17:48:24,401 --> 17:48:26,343
Like I know it started disappearing.

49
17:48:27,164 --> 17:48:32,590
It's just that very subtle tan goldish color that is in there.

50
17:48:33,551 --> 17:48:45,523
It's really distinct from, it's like in the background compared to those darker mare patches.

51
17:48:47,512 --> 17:49:17,130
the shadows just make these rims so distinct of these impact basins these impact craters it's really cool how you can really start to see the superposition one on top of the other you see the more dulled ones and then you can see the ones on top of them oh my eyeballs just switched all of a sudden craters look like mounds gotta put it back gotta put it back there we go

52
17:49:18,190 --> 17:49:20,532
Gotta remember where my sunlight's coming from.

53
17:49:20,552 --> 17:49:23,696
Now they look like craters again.

54
17:49:23,756 --> 17:49:24,596
Okay, good.

55
17:49:25,838 --> 17:49:29,401
Still no more Impact Flashes.

56
17:49:30,923 --> 17:49:32,644
Still haven't seen one.

57
17:49:34,406 --> 17:49:36,228
Gonna keep my eyes peeled, though.

58
17:49:38,070 --> 17:49:48,180
It really does, like, at this point, it's just... You know, not spending the time looking at my, uh...

59
17:49:48,599 --> 17:50:18,268
my recorder screen or my my pcd i really can just start to just get lost the the rotation is so slow it just feels like the moon is just standing still in front of us and you know feels like we're standing still right in front of it just amazing that i know the speed that we're going at to get back to you all and here we are

60
17:50:20,830 --> 17:50:23,332
Just feel like we're just standing still.

61
17:50:23,352 --> 17:50:29,338
I know that our time looking for Impact Flashes is nearing an end.

62
17:50:30,899 --> 17:50:32,841
And so is the time of our flyby.

63
17:50:32,881 --> 17:50:39,987
This is going to be a cool story to tell everyone.

64
17:50:44,551 --> 17:50:45,813
What am I doing on my plan?

65
17:50:47,154 --> 17:50:48,475
Trying to keep my eyes on it.

66
17:50:49,400 --> 17:50:51,082
I still have lots of time.

67
17:50:51,122 --> 17:50:55,969
This is a very long observation, this straight 10 minutes.

68
17:51:00,836 --> 17:51:06,804
Gonna keep watching though.

69
17:51:09,548 --> 17:51:11,851
This one I really wish I had like five eyes.

70
17:51:11,871 --> 17:51:19,221
So I could keep two on the Impact Flashes and just spend the rest of the time looking at the rest of the moon.

71
17:51:23,032 --> 17:51:25,396
Just gotta keep knocking that out for it.

72
17:51:39,899 --> 17:51:44,466
Really is an amazing little piece of Earth we're looking at.

73
17:52:05,303 --> 17:52:08,367
Still haven't seen anything yet.

74
17:52:10,510 --> 17:52:12,953
So just really want one of those.

75
17:52:13,033 --> 17:52:15,636
I can't let Trevor be the only one who saw one.

76
17:52:19,241 --> 17:52:27,291
It's like, man, what a time to be looking down at my PCD.

77
17:52:28,373 --> 17:52:30,315
I missed a new crater being born.

78
17:52:44,082 --> 17:52:54,875
Alright, I'm gonna...

79
17:52:57,999 --> 17:53:00,041
Pretty neat.

80
17:53:00,061 --> 17:53:05,127
Yeah, now I can still just hear Trevor talking about how jazzed he was that he saw an impact flash.

81
17:53:05,608 --> 17:53:06,329
So jealous.

82
17:53:10,614 --> 17:53:13,397
But that's good for science overall and we are a team.

83
17:53:22,321 --> 17:53:43,688
I think this is the coolest way to end a flyby, just staring at the moon like this.

84
17:53:56,442 --> 17:54:00,168
Yeah, pretty cool, just watched Yaskovsky there on the Terminator.

85
17:54:20,017 --> 17:54:23,142
I don't know, it's nearing the end of my Impact Flash time.

86
17:54:23,262 --> 17:54:25,285
I still haven't been that lucky yet.

87
17:54:25,906 --> 17:54:28,692
Still just enjoying watching the Terminator go by.

88
17:54:28,712 --> 17:54:34,404
Ah, I see ya.

89
17:54:34,424 --> 17:54:36,248
I heard about Tioskovsky.

90
17:54:36,288 --> 17:54:43,063
There's a crater that is above it and below it it has like another little crater that looks like a little set of headphones.

91
17:54:43,785 --> 17:54:44,927
That's pretty cool.

92
17:54:52,180 --> 17:55:00,568
I think it's really nice to still have these noise-canceling Peloton headsets, Pelotor headsets on and just sort of immerse yourself in the moon.

93
17:55:01,649 --> 17:55:10,757
I think it's actually a much nicer use being separated from the noise and the busyness of the spacecraft.

94
17:55:16,162 --> 17:55:19,825
Knowing that our friends are keeping us

95
17:55:20,395 --> 17:55:24,741
keeping you all updated on what they're seeing and what we're looking at right now.

96
17:55:29,967 --> 17:55:36,295
I'm really curious about that color that's still there.

97
17:55:36,776 --> 17:55:39,560
It would have been neat to sort of...

98
17:55:39,580 --> 17:55:48,411
I know that you all have talked about it a lot, but just seeing that distinct color difference is really pretty incredible.

99
17:55:55,073 --> 17:55:57,934
Alright, I think that ends my impact flash time.

100
17:55:57,974 --> 17:56:00,915
Thanks for hanging on.

17:46:01,668 --> 17:46:09,578
All right, looks like our last target before we get moving from this activity.

2
17:46:09,898 --> 17:46:18,248
And I'm going to sadly miss it, but this is Get Ahead Target Hotel, the South Poleaitken Basin Region.

3
17:46:18,288 --> 17:46:24,656
So what a good handoff to our future Artemis III friends and looking at the South Poleaitken Basin Region.

4
17:46:25,377 --> 17:46:31,084
And going to take a mosaic of that in a west to east snake pattern with 50% overlap.

5
17:46:31,638 --> 17:46:32,439
Tell you what I can see.

6
17:46:40,489 --> 17:46:47,779
First I'm gonna capture a regional image of the entire South Poleaitken Basin area, about 1 5th of the moon.

7
17:46:47,839 --> 17:46:49,901
Start to zoom in.

8
17:46:50,742 --> 17:46:59,113
What I will say is that with the way the Terminator is right now, probably can barely see what the South Poleaitken Basin is happening right now on the west side.

9
17:47:00,123 --> 17:47:05,509
So it's gonna be a challenging mosaic.

10
17:47:05,529 --> 17:47:12,736
It's pretty much only a three shot mosaic at the 400 millimeter extent.

11
17:47:14,658 --> 17:47:24,088
Take some 400 millimeter extents just centered on the South Poleaitken Basin, pretty dark down there right now based on that Terminator position.

12
17:47:24,148 --> 17:47:28,392
Maybe if you stretch some of these images, it'd be interesting to see what pops out.

13
17:47:31,308 --> 17:47:36,896
Going to take one along the entire Terminator with the camera in a horizontal position.

14
17:47:51,698 --> 17:47:57,366
Yeah, as far as features down there, it's really challenging, even through using the camera lens.

15
17:47:57,937 --> 17:48:07,972
I will say one of the craters down there, it looks like it has a little two eyes and a smiley face that is popping out right now based on the Terminator conditions.

16
17:48:09,194 --> 17:48:13,099
The lighting is really illuminating its west face right now of that crater rim.

17
17:48:14,141 --> 17:48:25,918
Pretty much the only one that I see topography, no color or albedo changes that are really striking right now just because of how dark it is down there.

18
17:48:26,557 --> 17:48:34,185
The current conditions just aren't great for anything to be observed in that realm of color or albedo.

19
17:48:36,407 --> 17:48:40,372
Just taking out some closing photos here of Target Hotel.

20
17:48:40,432 --> 17:48:43,535
And yeah, just some few final thoughts.

21
17:48:43,635 --> 17:48:45,677
It's just dramatic to see the moon like this.

22
17:48:45,757 --> 17:48:54,066
I almost like seeing the moon more with this half Terminator just because of the topography that's popping out across the center third right now.

23
17:48:54,839 --> 17:49:20,357
Yeah, it's dramatic when you see the full illuminated moon, but it's really also very cool to me to see this half moon with this dramatic Terminator and then think about the South Poleaitken Basin Region in our next Artemis mission that will go and touch the lunar surface exactly where my red dot is on my camera viewfinder right now.

24
17:49:21,265 --> 17:49:28,932
Godspeed to Artemis 3 and closing out the final lunar targeting image now.

25
17:49:29,675 --> 17:49:32,946
And hopefully see you guys back on the ground soon.

### Transcript 060

1
17:47:00,537 --> 17:47:07,225
Alright, our very last one in my get-ahead is the South Poleaitken Basin Region.

2
17:47:07,405 --> 17:47:19,940
I've been talking about it a little bit here, but definitely able to, now that I'm able to not be looking for Impact Flashes anymore, really focus on it some more.

3
17:47:20,521 --> 17:47:29,211
You can really, the, sort of, it looks so flat and smooth compared to the Terminator region.

4
17:47:31,435 --> 17:47:36,081
As I said before, that yellowish-brown tint is still there.

5
17:47:36,142 --> 17:47:42,290
You can really tell it between Mare Anjanae and Apollo Basin.

6
17:47:42,811 --> 17:47:49,360
You can really see that area as well as that sort of background color.

7
17:47:49,542 --> 17:47:56,515
And so I can sort of follow the mari there definitely still have a slightly different color from this angle as well.

8
17:47:56,535 --> 17:48:03,487
It's almost a little bit of a brownish tinge compared to like say up in Muscovy and say Basin.

9
17:48:04,590 --> 17:48:06,894
Sort of that darker unit.

10
17:48:07,174 --> 17:48:13,626
I just can't wait to know that somebody's gonna land there one day and

11
17:48:14,652 --> 17:48:20,821
I hope that some of our images can help this as well and some of these observations.

12
17:48:21,622 --> 17:48:26,629
Really be cool to get down there and get some boots on the ground and see what those footprints look like.

13
17:48:35,902 --> 17:48:43,393
It's definitely that it's so much easier like on the closer to the limb to see that color difference.

14
17:48:43,829 --> 17:48:54,947
And you could always see that sort of like ovular shape of South Polican before, but as you got a little bit closer to the Terminator, that difference sort of disappears.

15
17:48:55,007 --> 17:48:58,292
You can't really tell where that color really stops.

16
17:48:59,374 --> 17:49:06,445
It just sort of becomes overcome by the illumination environment.

17
17:49:07,353 --> 17:49:12,860
I'm gonna look and see if I can find Schrodinger Basin down there.

18
17:49:13,020 --> 17:49:22,893
Oh, maybe that is it Just there waiting for a Henderson et al 2025-2026 to come out.

19
17:49:23,654 --> 17:49:29,441
I hear it's gonna be a good one I can see a little bit of it down there.

20
17:49:29,922 --> 17:49:34,187
That'd be a really neat place to go with those cool pyroclastic deposits

21
17:49:34,724 --> 17:50:02,537
see that the largest volcanic cone on the moon I can almost just pull I can maybe maybe I'm just fooling myself down there that giant cone um that's one of the things that I can't really see well there is um let me see

22
17:50:30,108 --> 17:50:34,955
Yeah, I think it might be that point care region maybe that we're seeing right there.

23
17:50:37,559 --> 17:50:38,500
Is that the one?

24
17:50:38,821 --> 17:50:39,302
Maybe.

25
17:50:42,686 --> 17:50:49,817
You can see down there the larger basin that's got the two smaller rims inside of it.

26
17:50:51,379 --> 17:50:55,305
Definitely that bright high crest sort of hitting the

27
17:50:55,707 --> 17:50:58,831
getting the light before it disappears into the darkness.

28
17:50:58,951 --> 17:51:00,353
It's a pretty neat sight.

29
17:51:01,675 --> 17:51:10,247
Just knowing that, that's definitely looks so different than the rest of the moon and we're going to be able to get a better view of it one day.

30
17:51:10,287 --> 17:51:11,709
So I think this is it.

31
17:51:11,729 --> 17:51:21,562
And next time that some human eyeballs are looking at this, hopefully they're, they're going to be getting ready to go on the ground and we can't wait to be a part of it.

32
17:51:22,083 --> 17:51:23,605
Go team Artemis.
