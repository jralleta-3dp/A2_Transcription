1
14:53:02,174 --> 14:53:06,041
All right, starting target 19 still in window number three.

2
14:53:06,101 --> 14:53:17,421
I've got a really good config with the PCD kind of set up in front of me where I can glance down at it and both look out window three and make the observations now.

3
14:53:17,481 --> 14:53:21,308
So starting number 19 with the three of three of the Whole Moon.

4
14:53:22,430 --> 14:53:26,798
I'll just kind of give you my impression from the Terminator going to

5
14:53:27,149 --> 14:53:36,864
the bright limb, so essentially from west to east, and make some observations as I do that over the course of the next few minutes.

6
14:53:37,165 --> 14:53:39,969
So right at the Terminator, I mean, it's black.

7
14:53:40,490 --> 14:53:44,136
The hearth out there is beautiful still, so my eye is still drawn to those colors.

8
14:53:44,857 --> 14:53:51,047
But deep in the Terminator, I can't pick out features until I get right to a pretty distinct line.

9
14:53:51,719 --> 14:53:55,202
Right now it's at, I think, Sokoski.

10
14:53:55,262 --> 14:54:02,108
The Terminator is really highlighting the terrain or the rim of Sokoski.

11
14:54:02,949 --> 14:54:07,673
The western limb of Sokoski crater is just really highlighted and the central peak.

12
14:54:08,854 --> 14:54:14,559
I can almost convince myself I'm seeing the shadow of the central peak of Sokoski on its western limb.

13
14:54:15,500 --> 14:54:17,562
That would be really interesting to see through the camera.

14
14:54:17,582 --> 14:54:21,405
Hopefully she's capturing some of that in the camera right now.

15
14:54:21,976 --> 14:54:24,579
The topography is really popping.

16
14:54:24,619 --> 14:54:30,065
Those craters are really distinct along the Terminator, north and south of Silkoski.

17
14:54:30,105 --> 14:54:43,519
And it's not too far past Silkoski crater, maybe one or two Silkoski crater diameters away that the terrain starts to lose some of that sharpness that the illumination provides.

18
14:54:44,540 --> 14:54:49,165
Another beautiful area, make sure I'm getting

19
14:54:49,735 --> 14:55:01,411
my orientation right is like the, there's Muscovians basin, which is starting to, starting to get some of that topography advantage from the illumination.

20
14:55:01,871 --> 14:55:10,803
So I'm really looking forward to keeping an eye on that one as we continue to terminate or continues to move towards Muscovians.

21
14:55:10,924 --> 14:55:17,953
But also that larger basin that's to the south and a little bit west of

22
14:55:18,203 --> 14:55:28,980
Muscovian basin that's about the same size is really just it's amazing how flat and stark that is across the center of that larger crater.

23
14:55:29,000 --> 14:55:41,199
As I move more mid in line with the lunar surface, you know, the reflections and albedo are pretty dramatic in that area.

24
14:55:41,319 --> 14:55:43,823
So I can definitely pick out some of the high

25
14:55:44,242 --> 14:55:46,104
albedo crater rays.

26
14:55:46,124 --> 14:55:51,571
There's one that looks almost like a perfect little star, a five-pointed star, almost central on the moon.

27
14:55:52,372 --> 14:55:55,976
It doesn't show up in any kind of images that I see.

28
14:55:56,017 --> 14:56:09,774
And moving down to the crater that's just south of that, I think that's Mari Injani, if I double check in here.

29
14:56:10,574 --> 14:56:13,438
Yeah, so it's around Aitken Crater, Mari Injani area.

30
14:56:13,925 --> 14:56:24,279
That terrain starts to get a little bit darker and albedo and maybe a little bit more sharp in the topography in that area.

31
14:56:24,479 --> 14:56:33,291
Not sure why my eyes are picking up a little bit more, maybe because of just the darker albedo of that area.

32
14:56:33,311 --> 14:56:35,293
I see the topography maybe a little more.

33
14:56:36,775 --> 14:56:40,320
Jackson Crater right now, if my eyes move back up, is just

34
14:56:40,570 --> 14:56:49,344
gleaming almost white with those crater rays just stretching across at least a third or half of the moon.

35
14:56:49,384 --> 14:56:59,099
Again, I mentioned previously that wedge of Jackson that seems like it's missing from eight o'clock to about two o'clock.

36
14:57:00,000 --> 14:57:08,333
Just cannot pick up any rays in that direction, but a lot of distinct other rays in the other cardinal directions.

37
14:57:08,853 --> 14:57:18,407
And then finally, the full eastern limb is pretty high albedo or high illumination right now.

38
14:57:18,767 --> 14:57:22,072
Just totally lose the topography along that rim as expected.

39
14:57:23,554 --> 14:57:31,806
And really hard to pick out any major craters, features, basins as my eyes move towards the east.

40
14:57:32,393 --> 14:57:35,777
Just one more quick word about the Earth out there.

41
14:57:36,298 --> 14:57:45,308
There's really great shot out the window right now with Earth kind of standing off in the distance, but still within frame of the moon.

42
14:57:45,829 --> 14:57:52,677
And this Terminator really makes a dramatic image that we're hopefully capturing for the world to see.

43
14:57:53,418 --> 14:58:00,747
So with that, I'll end Target 19 and take a look at here at Aiken and get started on our next targets.
