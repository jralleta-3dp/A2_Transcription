16:01:02,225 --> 16:01:04,507
All right, Houston, Angela here.

2
16:01:04,527 --> 16:01:12,055
I am, I was troubleshooting Kelsey's PCDs, so I definitely missed Babaloff.

3
16:01:13,296 --> 16:01:16,799
Trying to get quickly back into Earthset, because I see it right now.

4
16:01:16,899 --> 16:01:20,183
So let me get some pictures of Earthset.

5
16:01:20,663 --> 16:01:24,587
And I'm taking them of the screen.

6
16:01:29,792 --> 16:01:31,894
Yeah, okay, as I am,

7
16:01:32,954 --> 16:01:41,843
Looking closer, you want me to focus on an Earth atmosphere.

8
16:01:41,863 --> 16:01:48,589
I'm not seeing, it just looks like a perfect, clear-boundaried marble.

9
16:01:48,609 --> 16:02:02,303
Oh, yeah, maybe I'm seeing a little bit of blue reflection coming from, only I can totally see it when I'm zoomed in.

10
16:02:02,890 --> 16:02:15,768
but perhaps a little bit of this kind of neon, maybe not neon, like a, how do I describe that?

11
16:02:18,652 --> 16:02:20,194
Just like a true blue.

12
16:02:20,255 --> 16:02:31,210
And I'm checking my camera viewfinder to make sure that that color comes through, but I'm definitely seeing some

13
16:02:40,100 --> 16:02:40,501
blue.

14
16:02:42,703 --> 16:02:52,957
This is hard.

15
16:02:52,997 --> 16:02:58,043
In terms of atmospheric patterns, I see some swirling of moons.

16
16:02:58,163 --> 16:03:07,035
The bright white of Antarctica is much of a truer white than the gray

17
16:03:07,555 --> 16:03:33,445
of the of the highlands and so the the clouds and those are polar ice caps are a great comparison for a true white because now that I'm looking at those in comparison to the highlands especially when I'm kind of zooming out a little bit we'll call it the thing that's the the truest color is actually the

18
16:03:33,728 --> 16:03:45,143
the dead center of Crooks is probably what I'm seeing as like the truest white when I compare it to the clouds on the Earth.

19
16:03:48,007 --> 16:03:55,516
It's sad to see the Earthset behind the moon, but I know I'll see it on the other side.

20
16:03:55,536 --> 16:03:59,922
I got some pictures

21
16:04:01,268 --> 16:04:09,442
I'm just gonna make sure I get some of the all zoomed angles.

22
16:04:16,534 --> 16:04:26,331
It's really great to have it have the lens zoomed in as I can watch it go but also kind of step back and see

23
16:04:28,724 --> 16:04:30,126
with it, with my naked eye.

24
16:04:30,667 --> 16:04:35,153
And this is the moment where the moon fully disappears.

25
16:04:35,794 --> 16:04:47,050
That was a beautiful, beautiful thing that I just got to witness.

26
16:04:55,743 --> 16:04:55,963
Okay.
