1
15:13:01,972 --> 15:13:06,298
All right, starting target 23 with the camera and Jackson.

2
15:13:07,500 --> 15:13:15,872
Captured a lot of Jackson when I was taking photos of the target 22 crater region area.

3
15:13:15,892 --> 15:13:26,848
So I'm a little behind on the timeline with Jackson, but I think I'll make it up here just knowing that I captured a lot of Jackson in that last crater or that last camera sequence.

4
15:13:27,503 --> 15:13:30,647
Gonna double check to make sure I get everything that you want.

5
15:13:30,707 --> 15:13:38,698
So you want photographs of the center of the entire ray system at the highest focal length and multiple overlapping images as needed.

6
15:13:38,738 --> 15:13:42,243
So I'm gonna go ahead and make some observations of Jackson when I do that.

7
15:13:43,044 --> 15:13:52,296
But again, look at all the images that I took of target 21, or sorry, target 22,

8
15:13:53,018 --> 15:14:00,291
because there's a lot of great photos of Jackson in there based on some of that image.

9
15:14:00,551 --> 15:14:08,064
Specifically going to try to target on some of the rays of Jackson with the highest imaging.

10
15:14:08,144 --> 15:14:15,617
So I'm going to take, I've got a series of images that zoomed in on Jackson from lowest to highest zoom.

11
15:14:16,002 --> 15:14:31,857
and I'm gonna take from the highest of zoom and work out some of the ray systems to the south and north of Jackson to the furthest extent that I can view them, which is a long, long way.

12
15:14:31,877 --> 15:14:42,567
So I just took a series of six photos to the south, starting at the center of Jackson and going south.

13
15:14:45,162 --> 15:15:04,406
at the highest resolution, did the same, a series of three going to the north, and then a series of five going to that ray that is headed towards Muscovian's Basin.

14
15:15:04,446 --> 15:15:12,216
And last thing I'm gonna do here with Jackson is capture it in a context photo.

15
15:15:12,376 --> 15:15:13,718
I've got a couple of these now,

16
15:15:15,402 --> 15:15:21,493
Make sure that I capture the whole upper northern two-thirds of the moon.

17
15:15:21,513 --> 15:15:30,109
And an image that is well-centered and frames all of Jackson Rays and includes Muscovian's Basin.

18
15:15:32,173 --> 15:15:34,838
Gonna take a few in a couple different orientations with the camera.

19
15:15:36,000 --> 15:15:38,625
Captures the whole eastern limb.

20
15:15:48,038 --> 15:15:50,241
and close out Jackson.

21
15:15:50,801 --> 15:15:57,869
Man, it's a really unique crater that the camera allows you to see some of the grade system like your naked eye does not pick up.

22
15:15:58,270 --> 15:16:13,067
The albedo doesn't seem to change as you get away from that central crater, but the central crater is a high albedo, definitely distinct and really dramatic through the camera lens.

23
15:16:14,077 --> 15:16:20,712
And with that, I will close out target 23 Jackson Crater and it looks like moving on to Jules Verne next.
