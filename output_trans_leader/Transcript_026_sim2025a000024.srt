1
16:06:01,904 --> 16:06:05,028
Okay, starting a new recording.

2
16:06:06,230 --> 16:06:09,794
I'm glad I was able to capture Earthset.

3
16:06:10,075 --> 16:06:13,339
Let me actually make sure I can tag that picture.

4
16:06:13,359 --> 16:06:19,507
This is me tagging this picture.

5
16:06:19,567 --> 16:06:21,069
Okay.

6
16:06:21,530 --> 16:06:22,812
Uh, successfully did that.

7
16:06:22,832 --> 16:06:23,172
Sorry.

8
16:06:23,212 --> 16:06:31,303
This, that was information from Earthset and not my current target, which is target 13.

9
16:06:32,127 --> 16:06:33,272
Korolev Basin Basin.

10
16:06:34,959 --> 16:06:41,547
So let me get oriented on the objectives for Korolev Basin.

11
16:07:00,764 --> 16:07:26,198
Yeah, it's a little bit difficult to tell because Okay, I'm in my lunar geography review just to help get the colors back Yeah, definitely

12
16:07:28,000 --> 16:07:44,308
I see Crooks and I see Jackson and Korolev Basin is right underneath the high albedo crater.

13
16:07:44,549 --> 16:07:47,894
Okay, I think I've oriented myself.

14
16:07:48,616 --> 16:07:52,843
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

15
16:07:58,460 --> 16:08:01,444
Just making sure I'm taking pictures of the right thing, but okay.

16
16:08:01,464 --> 16:08:02,285
Understood.

17
16:08:02,345 --> 16:08:03,767
Feedback received.

18
16:08:05,129 --> 16:08:07,732
Let me go get some shots of Korolev Basin.

19
16:08:10,215 --> 16:08:18,045
It's actually easier to find Korolev Basin through my camera now that I can zoom in, so I probably should have done that earlier.

20
16:08:18,105 --> 16:08:27,758
Alright, so yeah, because even up here, even if I'm not 100% sure,

21
16:08:27,974 --> 16:08:31,399
that I'm looking at it, I will 100% get the photo.

22
16:08:32,300 --> 16:08:40,433
Because in my highest zoom length, there's a lot of overlap in this area.

23
16:08:40,733 --> 16:08:45,300
So I'm going to make sure I have good coverage of this zoom.

24
16:08:51,569 --> 16:08:57,458
OK, so trying to focus.

25
16:08:58,872 --> 16:09:02,718
in and let me figure out what you still want.

26
16:09:15,356 --> 16:09:17,339
Okay, let me look at some of this.

27
16:09:20,183 --> 16:09:24,709
The topography, which it's actually just it's just not that obvious, honestly.

28
16:09:24,729 --> 16:09:28,795
I wish it stood out a little bit more, but it's not.

29
16:09:29,315 --> 16:09:54,394
Um, I definitely have pictures of Korolev Basin in my viewfinder, um, but I'm just really not seeing any, um, of these kind of cryptomare, um, versus just like any of these, these textures that you're, um, kind of indicating on the, on the LTP.

30
16:10:01,968 --> 16:10:09,137
I'm honestly still not 100% confident that I'm observing the specific crater.

31
16:10:09,477 --> 16:10:12,240
It's just a little bit difficult to tell.

32
16:10:12,320 --> 16:10:18,047
But I can promise you that I have several overlapping pictures of this area.

33
16:10:18,928 --> 16:10:26,537
But in terms of description, even my zoom lens of my naked eye, there's not great topography that are showing up.

34
16:10:26,978 --> 16:10:31,283
So with that, let me continue to move on.
