16:11:05,161 --> 16:11:05,902
Angela here.

2
16:11:05,942 --> 16:11:14,991
OK, I am back with you and I see my next target is 14 Oppenheimer Basin.

3
16:11:15,212 --> 16:11:22,740
It's a high priority, so let me get great image coverage of it because I have the camera at the moment.

4
16:11:28,446 --> 16:11:29,246
Right, I'm gonna.

5
16:11:31,989 --> 16:11:32,670
Look at.

6
16:11:34,372 --> 16:11:35,073
Apollo.

7
16:11:35,093 --> 16:11:49,491
And then I'm going to zoom in and make sure that I can get Alpenheuer, which is right next to Apollo.

8
16:11:50,192 --> 16:11:56,981
Yep, just double checking my LTP that it is the cluster of three.

9
16:11:58,503 --> 16:12:04,210
Well, actually, what's obvious to me is that it kind of looks like three Mari patches within this

10
16:12:04,898 --> 16:12:07,042
within this greater crater.

11
16:12:07,102 --> 16:12:25,152
So I'll just make sure I get focus on some of the low points and the higher points so hopefully you can get that good mosaic of it.

12
16:12:30,076 --> 16:12:34,062
I will make sure to get Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin in one single frame.

13
16:12:34,322 --> 16:12:40,951
I just saw that target.

14
16:12:40,971 --> 16:12:44,036
Yeah, let me try to compare these two.

15
16:12:44,076 --> 16:12:57,294
There's a lot more diffuse boundaries in the Oppenheimer Basin Mare patches than the Apollo Mare patches.

16
16:12:57,354 --> 16:12:59,357
They're much more distinct and sharp.

17
16:13:00,299 --> 16:13:06,649
in Apollo versus Oppenheimer Basin, which is, again, that diffuse type of boundary.

18
16:13:08,952 --> 16:13:09,754
I'm also here.

19
16:13:11,757 --> 16:13:14,381
If I get at a better angle, maybe I can see this.

20
16:13:14,461 --> 16:13:18,527
So now I'm kind of clocked a little bit.

21
16:13:19,486 --> 16:13:23,610
differently, so if you see that change in angle, that's why.

22
16:13:23,650 --> 16:13:34,883
I'm just trying to focus on the crater ray that's coming from Crook's that's separating these two craters.

23
16:13:34,963 --> 16:13:49,358
Let me zoom out a little bit just to make sure I get Crook's in the photo, but then I will just like kind of slowly zoom in and then I'm at my max zoom now focusing on that.

24
16:13:50,536 --> 16:13:57,445
crater ray, which is almost at the boundary of Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin.

25
16:13:58,887 --> 16:14:19,733
In general, for the color tones and differences between Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo Basin, I would say Oppenheimer Basin has darker, deeper tones than Apollo.

26
16:14:22,312 --> 16:14:33,885
The deepest of the tones is of the three kind of dark patches that are within Oppenheimer Basin.

27
16:14:34,526 --> 16:14:45,838
The top one is the darkest.

28
16:14:55,707 --> 16:14:58,232
Let me just make sure I'm on timeline still.

29
16:14:58,272 --> 16:14:59,815
Okay, I am.

30
16:14:59,835 --> 16:15:12,518
Okay, I'm gonna leave it there and take a few more pictures.
