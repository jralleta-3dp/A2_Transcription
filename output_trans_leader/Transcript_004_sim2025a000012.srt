1
14:54:12,805 --> 14:54:20,514
And then I can see a little bit of that.

2
14:54:20,534 --> 14:54:28,404
There's sort of a dull, sort of orange-brownish that is the background grey.

3
14:54:28,684 --> 14:54:35,912
The very bright, greater rays are overlapping that.

4
14:54:35,932 --> 14:54:39,477
I can see the ones from Jackson and Ulm.

5
14:54:39,497 --> 14:54:41,479
And it cooks very brightly here.

6
14:54:42,235 --> 14:54:55,448
I can see how that Jackson Crater Ray goes all the way down into a cave basin.

7
14:54:57,831 --> 14:55:04,397
My general impressions is that I'm just chiming on, looking here, just knowing that we are passing the moon.

8
14:55:04,417 --> 14:55:08,361
Just seeing the colors, I can really see the darkness there of the Mari.

9
14:55:14,146 --> 14:55:29,430
So I can see those pretty large features from both that South Lake and Bay Sand.

10
14:55:29,450 --> 14:55:35,800
It's sort of a different hue behind sort of a dark horn here than some of the colors that are behind.

11
14:55:47,828 --> 14:56:14,848
the moon like this and all of its glory it's just amazing it's really happy to be standing here like this let's see I can really really start to see some of those are there some um the train there

12
14:56:48,882 --> 14:57:04,545
So I think that is the end of my first recording.
