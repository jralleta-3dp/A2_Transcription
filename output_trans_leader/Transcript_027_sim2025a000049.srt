16:06:01,212 --> 16:06:03,594
Okay, Kelsey is back with you here.

2
16:06:03,634 --> 16:06:10,420
My PCD just froze up on me, so I had to hard reset the PCD.

3
16:06:10,661 --> 16:06:13,663
And because of that, I missed several targets.

4
16:06:14,344 --> 16:06:17,387
I missed Babaloff, and unfortunately I did miss Earthset.

5
16:06:18,187 --> 16:06:20,549
But here I am at Korolev Basin Basin.

6
16:06:20,569 --> 16:06:30,038
I will say at first glance, it is very hard to see Korolev Basin with the current view that I have.

7
16:06:30,288 --> 16:06:44,451
I can see Favaloff, which is of course one of the targets that I missed, but Korolev Basin is nearly impossible to detect.

8
16:06:45,834 --> 16:06:54,328
I'm going to take a minute and try to get oriented here, especially since I just kind of got out of observations to try to troubleshoot the PCD.

9
16:06:55,410 --> 16:06:56,852
You know, I do see

10
16:06:58,756 --> 16:07:23,025
understand I'm looking for kind of a smoother spot that's looks to be younger because it has fewer craters but at the current view right here all I'm really seeing I don't really see topography due to the the illumination angle right now and I'm looking and you know I see go back to my geography review here

11
16:07:25,958 --> 16:07:29,504
I'm trying to switch around my views to see if there's anything I can kind of do here.

12
16:07:29,564 --> 16:07:32,869
Figure that out.

13
16:07:35,053 --> 16:07:52,962
I think I can see Crooks beautifully, and I understand that Korolev Basin should be to the upper right of it, but it is swamped out by the sort of really bright albedo colors of a crater that's unlabeled in the geography review.

14
16:07:53,313 --> 16:07:57,580
That's sort of just to the upper left of Korolev Basin by upper left.

15
16:07:57,600 --> 16:08:03,970
I am still oriented in the window such that I am My head is facing lunar north.

16
16:08:04,411 --> 16:08:11,001
So it's just to to sort of the upper left left of Korolev Basin So, let me see here

17
16:08:12,770 --> 16:08:16,956
It's nearly impossible to identify any topography.

18
16:08:17,016 --> 16:08:24,527
All I see is sort of a white albedo patch in the area where I think Korolev Basin should be.

19
16:08:25,148 --> 16:08:30,276
It's not as bright white as the two craters on either side of it.

20
16:08:30,957 --> 16:08:41,612
It sort of just appears to be, you know, honestly, if you would have asked me to pick an area of the moon in my naked eye view right now, it's sort of the least distinct feature

21
16:08:41,862 --> 16:08:44,386
least distinct part of the moon that there is in my current view.

22
16:08:46,209 --> 16:08:52,879
So I'll take a look here and see if there's anything I can give you about your observation actions.

23
16:08:52,979 --> 16:08:58,788
But honestly, I can't really see any of the things that you're asking me to look out here with Korolev Basin.

24
16:09:00,030 --> 16:09:03,415
All right, Kelsey out and I'll move on to the next target.
