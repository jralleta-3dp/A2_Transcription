1
15:15:03,136 --> 15:15:05,639
All right, just starting Target 6.

2
15:15:05,840 --> 15:15:10,306
It looks like I'm a little behind on the timeline, so I'll make this one a little bit quicker.

3
15:15:10,326 --> 15:15:23,464
And I've definitely zoomed in with my eye, sorry, on Target 6, the Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and Bubba Crater, just south of Apollo Basin.

4
15:15:23,524 --> 15:15:32,637
The illumination down there is a little bit darker right now, so it's hard to pick out those two distinct craters that are next to each other.

5
15:15:33,325 --> 15:15:35,589
Actually struggling with that a little bit.

6
15:15:35,869 --> 15:15:48,009
I'm just indexing off of a dark patch that looks like to be the dark patch at the bottom of Bo's crater, if that's the one to my left or the west in the image.

7
15:15:49,091 --> 15:15:57,265
And that's the only one that I'm really picking up on is that Bo's crater to the left, if Bose And Bhabha Crater Region's to the right.

8
15:15:57,345 --> 15:15:59,248
And so again, just to make sure I'm clear there.

9
15:15:59,735 --> 15:16:03,881
So at three o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater in the image in the LDP.

10
15:16:04,342 --> 15:16:07,787
The one at seven o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

11
15:16:08,448 --> 15:16:12,314
And it's Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is actually popping out just below Apollo Crater.

12
15:16:12,675 --> 15:16:19,285
I don't see Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that distinct as what's captured in the LTP image.

13
15:16:21,348 --> 15:16:23,852
I will say a little bit more words about the color.

14
15:16:24,187 --> 15:16:32,516
So just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater, I do see a light patch that I don't see in any of the imagery on our PCDs.

15
15:16:33,177 --> 15:16:42,847
So there's a totally distinct little light patch just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is starting to really stick out to my eye as I continue to look out the window.

16
15:16:42,908 --> 15:16:47,933
One thing I will note is looking back and forth between the window and the,

17
15:16:48,352 --> 15:16:55,082
and the PCD, my eye does take a few minutes or a few seconds to adjust to pick up those subtle differences.

18
15:16:55,963 --> 15:17:11,406
So I've been trying to concentrate by looking out the window, but also make sure that I get the observations and actions in mind before I start the video recording so I can allow my eyes to adjust without looking down at the LTP too often.

19
15:17:11,960 --> 15:17:17,487
So just again, to focus on the color, albedo, and texture, I think I checked the box there.

20
15:17:17,567 --> 15:17:21,611
Texture's really hard to pick out in these illumination conditions.

21
15:17:22,673 --> 15:17:32,865
The only interior thing that I see is the bottom of bows, and that's the only reason that it's able to pick that out at all is a little bit of darker patch at the bottom of bows.

22
15:17:33,646 --> 15:17:36,729
And the relationship between the two is kind of what I described.

23
15:17:37,090 --> 15:17:39,773
I'm really having trouble seeing

24
15:17:40,073 --> 15:17:46,865
above a crater compared to Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and just really interested in that little white patch that's below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

25
15:17:46,945 --> 15:17:49,169
But nothing else really to add there.

26
15:17:49,530 --> 15:17:52,535
Kind of hard in this illumination conditions to pick that up.

27
15:17:52,555 --> 15:17:55,180
So that concludes target number six.
