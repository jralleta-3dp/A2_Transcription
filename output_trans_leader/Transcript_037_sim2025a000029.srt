16:33:01,212 --> 16:33:02,093
Angela with you.

2
16:33:02,113 --> 16:33:05,397
I got so distracted by my drawing at Dewar Crater Region Crater.

3
16:33:05,417 --> 16:33:08,680
I didn't realize I had a high priority target up next.

4
16:33:08,841 --> 16:33:20,414
So I think I'm a little bit, I'm definitely behind in my Sikofsky observations.

5
16:33:20,654 --> 16:33:24,038
So apologies about that, but I hope you'll like that, that drawing.

6
16:33:24,698 --> 16:33:27,962
Okay, I am,

7
16:33:29,748 --> 16:33:59,012
trying to find Sikovsky yeah because I'm a little bit late to this observation I pretty much see the entire outline of Sikovsky and then the so like the rim of the west rim of Sikovsky is illuminated and the central peak is illuminated

8
16:33:59,414 --> 16:34:01,758
That's the view I'm seeing right now.

9
16:34:03,560 --> 16:34:24,072
So I missed the initial where it was just behind the Terminator because it looks fully outside of the Terminator.

10
16:34:31,021 --> 16:34:41,197
I think the only, oh, and now that I'm looking at it, there's a little bit more of the basin of the crater that's illuminated.

11
16:34:41,377 --> 16:34:51,032
So to the north of the central peak, there is a slight color that comes through.

12
16:34:51,473 --> 16:34:58,243
I will screenshot it and, oh, wait, actually it's already in my, I keep forgetting that it's already in my LTP.

13
16:35:03,168 --> 16:35:08,926
Are we taking a break?

14
16:35:09,006 --> 16:35:11,895
Is it time?
