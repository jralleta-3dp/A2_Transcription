15:13:01,027 --> 15:13:02,631
Okay, so this is Marie.

2
15:13:02,892 --> 15:13:05,138
I now have the camera in my hand.

3
15:13:05,760 --> 15:13:10,733
I'm getting situated, getting ready to look for Crookes Crater.

4
15:13:17,007 --> 15:13:22,254
I'm now over in the other window and now I have the camera in my hand.

5
15:13:22,555 --> 15:13:23,416
I'm testing.

6
15:13:23,456 --> 15:13:31,628
It looks like that I can definitely focusing if I go the whole way zoomed in and can see the whole disc as I'm fully zoomed out.

7
15:13:32,429 --> 15:13:38,037
So I'm starting with Crookes Crater with the, as I can see is a photometric target.

8
15:13:38,455 --> 15:13:48,266
Um, and so has some intense looking at the albedo and texture and the theme for exterior, um, craters.

9
15:13:49,527 --> 15:13:58,917
And so I'm going to try to look in and I can see where Crookes Crater is.

10
15:13:59,678 --> 15:14:03,282
Um, it definitely has some bright gray systems as well.

11
15:14:03,717 --> 15:14:11,286
I can see that it's about halfway between Apollo and Jackson, which does match where it is on my LTP.

12
15:14:12,407 --> 15:14:19,116
And so I've got this, um, I'm able to get zoomed in on it there and get some images.

13
15:14:20,477 --> 15:14:24,162
And my, the bracketing that was set up is still working great.

14
15:14:24,963 --> 15:14:30,349
Um, so I'm zooming out a little bit, making sure that you can see the difference between

15
15:14:30,717 --> 15:15:00,538
Apollo to Jackson to really get that in there when I zoom in a little bit more I can see some I can't really see any of those Terra structures that are discussed, but I can see the gradation of the of the ray system so I'm trying to follow these rays all the way back up to Jackson and If these rays are actually they're a lot more dense around the center that we see here I

16
15:15:01,497 --> 15:15:04,740
And they don't look as streaky as like some of the rays around Jackson.

17
15:15:04,840 --> 15:15:08,003
It's sort of like a, they're almost looks like flower petals.

18
15:15:08,163 --> 15:15:14,029
They're much more, um, lighter in color and sort of condensed as well there.

19
15:15:15,270 --> 15:15:19,935
And so it makes it a little bit more difficult to like really see that streakiness.

20
15:15:20,615 --> 15:15:29,884
Um, like I said before, I really can't see much of the, the, the morphology or the boundaries actually look pretty gradational.

21
15:15:30,252 --> 15:15:32,195
in the ray system as well.

22
15:15:32,235 --> 15:15:36,582
I'm not able to see any of those terrace slopes that we talk about.

23
15:15:36,622 --> 15:15:39,847
That center is a really, really bright albedo.

24
15:15:42,091 --> 15:15:57,576
And it's very similar, not as bright as the one that you can see above in Jackson, but a little bit more similar to the one that is a little bit more northeast that I could probably see.

25
15:15:57,995 --> 15:16:02,079
um, with my laryngeography review, if I felt like opening that right now.

26
15:16:03,821 --> 15:16:12,489
Um, and so I'm looking, I'm supposed to really look and see the relationship, the rays on the material.

27
15:16:13,030 --> 15:16:26,803
Um, it looks like Jackson's rays actually come across, might cross this one a little bit more, but the rays are more defined along the darker, the light gray background of the moon that I can see there.

28
15:16:28,032 --> 15:16:47,927
but they really don't extend that far, sort of about the, it's like, you could look like the ray system sort of fits inside something like, like Muscoviente can sort of cover that whole ray system right there as well.

29
15:16:48,108 --> 15:16:50,091
So I'm gonna save this one.
