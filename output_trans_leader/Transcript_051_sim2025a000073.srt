1
17:18:01,921 --> 17:18:05,385
Okay, starting target 25 Jules Verne crater.

2
17:18:05,826 --> 17:18:08,489
I'm just kind of centered up on that.

3
17:18:09,370 --> 17:18:14,557
Oh, there's a few minute break between 24 and 25.

4
17:18:14,937 --> 17:18:20,284
So it looks like I got a little extra time on Jules Verne.

5
17:18:20,565 --> 17:18:23,248
So going to go ahead and capture this one right.

6
17:18:23,608 --> 17:18:27,894
The LTP has like a five minute break between 23 and 25.

7
17:18:28,495 --> 17:18:30,477
So it seems like we're missing 24.

8
17:18:34,777 --> 17:18:36,920
And so hopefully the LTP is right.

9
17:18:37,000 --> 17:18:39,504
I'm going to keep going with 25 with Jules Verne.

10
17:18:42,848 --> 17:18:47,795
Give me one second to get right back onto the target list.

11
17:18:47,835 --> 17:18:52,642
So looking for centered photographs at the highest focal length of Jules.

12
17:18:53,163 --> 17:18:59,492
And I've got pretty good eyes on it, was able to index off of Silkowski pretty easily.

13
17:18:59,512 --> 17:19:03,838
And so we're going to go ahead and start shooting some photos.

14
17:19:05,303 --> 17:19:14,957
that includes Tsiolkovsky, so you can also index off of it just like I did towards Jules.

15
17:19:18,963 --> 17:19:25,172
Overall, Jules is starting to become highlighted by that illumination of the Terminator.

16
17:19:26,073 --> 17:19:34,686
Topography is really starting to pop, especially to the north of it at 10 to two o'clock.

17
17:19:35,493 --> 17:19:39,098
There's a central little mare patch there.

18
17:19:39,158 --> 17:19:53,818
It's like the size of a cashew nut that starts to really stick out, distinct in its albedo.

19
17:19:56,342 --> 17:20:04,032
One of the things that just my eye keeps getting drawn to is that central peak of Silkoski, so trying to capture a few images of that while I can.

20
17:20:04,400 --> 17:20:07,153
just because it's so dramatic on the limb.

21
17:20:36,293 --> 17:20:47,812
Just taking a quick look back to make sure that everything's set up for this final little stretch and try not to miss Muscovian base and a high priority target coming up.

22
17:20:49,975 --> 17:20:59,871
Really one of the things that stuck out to me on Jules Verne is that distinct topography that's starting to pop in the illumination conditions.

23
17:21:17,738 --> 17:21:28,391
I've got plenty of photos that are at the highest resolution or highest zoom of the lens, 400 millimeters.

24
17:21:29,292 --> 17:21:33,817
A couple different orientations to try to capture that topography.

25
17:21:36,841 --> 17:21:40,925
My eye does pick up on the mare patch a little bit better.

26
17:21:40,946 --> 17:21:47,273
When I look above the camera, I can see that mare patch, that little cashew nut shape

27
17:21:47,658 --> 17:21:50,762
a little bit better than what I see through the window and through the lens.

28
17:21:51,644 --> 17:21:56,611
So just a note there that my eye is actually picking up that distinct color.

29
17:21:56,791 --> 17:22:05,363
I'm sure once you stretch these pictures a little bit, they'll be better than what my eye is seeing through the viewfinder.

30
17:22:08,507 --> 17:22:09,649
Okay, I'm gonna call that.

31
17:22:10,034 --> 17:22:18,155
good with Jules Verne target number 25 because I know my next high priority is 26 with Muscovian Basins, a high priority target for you guys.

32
17:22:19,077 --> 17:22:22,305
So closing out Jules Verne 25 now.
