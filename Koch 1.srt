00:00:00,925 --> 00:00:04,647
This is Christina Cook doing my verbal observation of Grimaldi Crater.

2
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:10,731
Grimaldi Crater is right on, from our view, I'm going to say the east side.

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:20,256
Again, I'm going to be speaking from our view, where east is on my right, west is on my left, and north-south is standard north-south.

4
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:27,050
From this view, Grimaldi Crater is a very distinctive dark mare area.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,133
It's about the same darkness as a mid-grade inside of Oriental.

6
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:34,213
It's not as dark as the darkest of Oriental.

7
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:38,575
It does not have any kind of a hint of a hue.

8
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:44,618
It just has a very similar gray to the other grays of the moon.

9
00:00:45,542 --> 00:01:03,226
would say that there's a gentle gradient of its darkness where the northern end is a little bit lighter than the southern end and it so that the the darkest part of the mare is the southern part.

10
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,427
From this oblique view it does appear to be fairly circular.

11
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:08,928
There's also a

12
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:22,965
an obvious second, much smaller mare, maybe about a fifth of the size of Grimaldi at its, I would say, 10 o'clock position.

13
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,267
It's northwest of Grimaldi.

14
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:38,936
And I don't see any kind of evidence of other terrain, any evidence of magnetic swirls or rays.

15
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:40,958
There may be some rays that

16
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:48,399
that kind of bisect Grimaldi, but they're not visible inside the mare.

17
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:56,322
There's kind of one line, looks like it maybe even could have been an old ray line from Oriental or something that transverses it.

18
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,684
But I think that it, the Grimaldi crater is newer than that.

19
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:01,724
It is on top of that.

20
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:12,028
That's about all I could offer in observations that there are some lighter points around it.

21
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:29,730
And he goes again, just straight into it.

22
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:41,916
Okay, I'm gonna go to my second target.

23
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,723
Hey Mark, this is Jackie.

24
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:56,416
I missed the first part of your call, but I thought that you wanted

25
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,620
So it is really on the edge.

26
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,903
In fact, it's not even visible past a couple of minutes here.

27
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:35,394
So, um, I would say the best thing we could do is just for photography, just, um, maybe they really want it as it's on the edge, like to see if there's any terrain or something.

28
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,698
So I think the best you could do is just like photograph that Mario area.

29
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,660
And I would do the actual limb.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,020
Let's see.

31
00:03:42,585 --> 00:04:09,806
terrace complex mostly flat crater does have a central piece so maybe you can get that this this view is near the north left limb yep it's in Oceanus Procellarum describe the colors and features exosphere so this is exosphere so yep all right highest zoom available crater and the limb so I would just dice that limb yeah okay mm-hmm

32
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:18,148
before I take my next set, I'm going to put like something as, think about the photos that we get a second shot.

33
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:18,888
Yeah.

34
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,769
I'll put like a two up and then I'll take pictures.

35
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,210
Perfect.

36
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,370
Okay.

37
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,910
I love it.

38
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:23,811
Yeah.

39
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,132
And yeah, that's great.

40
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:27,213
And then people also know it's you cause they see your hand.

41
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,034
Okay, cool.

42
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,536
Yeah, I need 14 hands.

43
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:33,876
Yeah.

44
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:36,517
That's funny.

45
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:37,978
You could do the four sideways.

46
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,553
But I don't know if that would work.

47
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,954
All right.

48
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:44,996
OK.

49
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:45,516
And.
