1
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,222
Christina here, working through my targeting.

2
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:08,966
Next up is number 16, Oppenheimer.

3
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:19,436
I am looking through the camera at the moment, and so I can get pretty close, zoomed in.

4
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,980
Oppenheimer and Apollo Basin right next to each other.

5
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,822
I'll say the first thing that stands out to me

6
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:28,258
are the color tones.

7
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:39,842
Oppenheimer has kind of this reddish hue to it, with its mare being more like almost like a dark purple.

8
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:44,844
And the mares that are really standing out to me are the kind of three

9
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:51,207
to the left side of the crater.

10
00:45:52,489 --> 00:46:11,047
And then as you go more towards Apollo Basin, the color tone changes pretty significantly because you have this big ray, this light-toned ray that's coming from Crooks that is just almost cutting

11
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:13,254
Oppenheimer in half.

12
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:29,341
It's going kind of close to straight up and down through the crater and proceeds double the length, at least, past the crater as well.

13
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:39,205
And in that ray, there's actually two tones of this kind of lighter hue that's also about equal

14
00:46:41,290 --> 00:47:01,398
on so i'll say that if you kind of split that ray in half vertically on the left side of it has this more of a maybe we'll call it like a tan like a a tanner browner light toned color and then on the right side of it closer to apollo basin it's definitely more of a

15
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:08,676
a lighter tan, I'll say, but there's a little bit of tonal difference with the lighter color closer towards Apollo Basin.

16
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:18,244
And then as you move more towards Apollo Basin, you have a reddish tone, but it's a little bit lighter than what I'm seeing in Oppenheimer.

17
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:26,312
And then the Mare also, instead of like the dark purples, if you call it like a little bit of darker purple in the Mare,

18
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:32,518
In Oppenheimer, in Apollo, it's more of like a bluer in the mare.

19
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:38,182
And then go into texture.

20
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:47,388
Let's see, Oppenheimer is a little bit, maybe I'd call it rougher than Apollo overall.

21
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:04,887
And I'm definitely seeing these kind of finer structures that are at the base, at the kind of basin of Oppenheimer.

22
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:13,653
And I can even see them in my LTP, but yeah, they're not present in Apollo either.

23
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:22,320
So I just see these kind of linear fractures and structures in Oppenheimer at the, at its basin.

24
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:40,078
Overall though, these kind of the margins of the mare, I would say, are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than Apollo.

25
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:47,903
Like there are some margins, like I said, those three kind of primary mare are what stands out.

26
00:48:49,044 --> 00:48:50,405
And what I mean by that,

27
00:48:53,462 --> 00:49:03,470
are there's the very circular, so if you're talking about Oppenheimer on the kind of left side of it, there's a really circular mare which has like two

28
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,361
it kind of horizontal notches to it.

29
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:12,942
And then below that, a little to the left, you have a little bit of a smaller splotch.

30
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:18,483
And then a little bit below that, a little bit more to the right, there's kind of a dark, diffuse mare patch.

31
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:30,246
Whereas Apollo, it's very clear that there are, instead of, like I said, the margins are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than they are in Apollo.

32
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:33,807
The Apollo mare is very clear,

33
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:43,998
lineation and differentiation between the light and the dark of the mare and the light-toned surrounding area.
