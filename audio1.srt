1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:05,221
All right, next up is Mare Injani.

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:10,345
I'm going to the forward window with the camera in hand.

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:16,310
It's just me up here trying to make a lot of observations, zooming in with my camera here.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,433
So I'm just going to do some talk out loud for you.

5
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:24,877
All right, so Injani, let me first orient myself.

6
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,620
I've got no oblique view from the lunar

7
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,524
targeting plan.

8
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:35,389
Let's see, north there, so go south.

9
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,714
Really just looking along the terminator.

10
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:43,561
That's what I expect my main indicator will be.

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,584
This is a pretty cool looking

12
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,673
cool looking mare.

13
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:51,033
Okay, so I see, okay, I've found SBA.

14
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:53,574
I'm looking just along the terminator.

15
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:58,136
It's like from this image that my plan.

16
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:04,098
Looking for mare info, got some irregular shapes spilling out.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,020
Yeah, okay, I'm not really seeing it yet.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,941
I'm just continue looking down.

19
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,083
Okay, I'm seeing a crater that has these kind of five

20
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,954
like, craters aligned within it.

21
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,579
You know, in this kind of elongated snowman-looking crater.

22
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,200
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,081
Okay, now I'm seeing it.

24
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:38,068
It kind of looks, this Injunai kind of looks like a, almost like an octopus shape, with the kind of legs of the octopus facing away from the Terminator.

25
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,990
All right, okay, I'm seeing it now.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,813
I think I was trying to look a little too early because it was still in shadow.

27
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,895
So, yeah, I see it now.

28
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:56,545
And it's a really clear circular shape where the boundary facing away from the Terminator is at the broken part of this kind of circle.

29
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:04,629
So it's not a complete circle because when I zoom in with my camera, there's almost this like elongated island in the broken boundary.

30
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,050
And that island is kind of like maybe less than a quarter.

31
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,408
of this overall shape.

32
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,816
And again, that kind of broken part of that circle is facing away from the Terminator.

33
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,078
That's really cool.

34
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:28,209
But yeah, overall Engine Eye also has like a raised, like bigger ridge that's like around and like encircling the crater.

35
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,350
It's at least an interrelating part of it.

36
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:39,975
Kind of looks like a C-shape from where I'm at now, where the opening of the C is kind of disappearing into the darkness of the Terminator.

37
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,517
So maybe I'll just keep an eye on that for the next time I come around here.

38
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:48,916
But yeah, the interior doesn't look solid.

39
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:55,163
It actually kind of has some albedo variations where there is lighter and darker, but I mean, I'm not really seeing a pattern in there.

40
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,486
So it doesn't really look smooth either.

41
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:04,192
That basin kind of looks undulating or hummocky, maybe even seeing a wrinkle in there.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,234
Yeah, and I'm also seeing like maybe, if I zoom in, I think I do see like little specks and little craters in here.

43
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:25,083
But yeah, that wrinkle is parallel and like kind of in the same strike as that island of that boundary that I described, that kind of broken outer boundary of Injani.

44
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,285
So that's cool.

45
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,848
I can't see too much more, so I'll end it there and then I'll come back to this in a little bit.
