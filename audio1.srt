00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,714
This is Marie for ImageA.

2
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:16,056
I'm looking at the Mare Crisium from the email and I'm looking at it with my eyes on a computer screen right in front of me.

3
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:23,958
The target is located in the northern hemisphere to the west of the visible moon.

4
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,480
It is to the east of Mare Trunculitatis and to the

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,822
west of Smithy and something else.

6
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:56,087
This is a pretty large mare filled crater that is smaller than the Mare Tranquilitatis to the west but pretty similar in size to the Mare Smithy down below.

7
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:10,754
And it is more circular in shape, almost looks like a snail or an eyeball where it has a circular piece with a little bit more coming off to the west.

8
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,337
The edges are not sharp.

9
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:23,363
They're more, they look scalloped, but that's just different, sort of rounded infills.

10
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,767
It is a, for color, it is a,

11
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:33,242
grayer tone than the surface around it.

12
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,783
It's got a lower albedo.

13
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,467
It is one of the darkest things that we see.

14
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:44,531
It is very similar to a lot of the other dark areas that are visible on the moon right now.

15
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,772
The color is not smooth.

16
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:54,319
It has lines and streaks of a lighter color across them, mostly originating from a

17
00:01:56,237 --> 00:02:01,319
bright raid crater to the west of the mare.

18
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,600
The texture looks smooth in this area of the moon.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
You can't see a lot of relief.

20
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:18,023
You can tell there are some smaller craters that are impacted into it, but a lot of the relief is on the visible eastern limb of the moon.

21
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:22,244
Let's see.

22
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:28,523
well defined compared to what's around it.

23
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:35,987
The slopes, the topography isn't very, it's very hard to pick out here.

24
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,508
You can tell that there are some imprinted impacts.

25
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:42,782
Let's see.

26
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:46,623
Some of the streaks are for radiologic relationships.

27
00:02:46,663 --> 00:03:04,929
Some of the streaks that are going across the mare seem to be radiating from other really bright craters, both to the sort of nine o'clock position to the west and more of like the 435 position down to the southeast.

28
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,810
And also there's a radiating bright crater

29
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:15,567
at the about 131 to 12 position up there.

30
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,012
Let's see.

31
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:31,704
For thoughts, this looks like a very dark area, very smooth, not a lot of details that can be picked out, but the largest changes that we're seeing here is albedo differences.

32
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,507
We'll call that one done.
