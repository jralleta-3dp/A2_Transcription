1
16:57:01,651 --> 16:57:05,295
Alright, starting on my next one, I finished that Whole Moon.

2
16:57:07,698 --> 16:57:20,133
I'm going to go to Aitken Crater Crater, and then what I'm going to be looking for here is the Compact Split Crater with Mare infill.

3
16:57:20,233 --> 16:57:27,962
So I'm looking to see if I can see any evidence of that scarp, the Raka X scarp.

4
16:57:28,634 --> 16:57:32,981
And so I want to get in the highest resolution that I can.

5
16:57:33,723 --> 16:57:38,410
So let me focus in on...

6
16:57:38,430 --> 16:57:40,454
There is Mari Injani.

7
16:57:49,489 --> 16:57:52,414
There's Mari Injani.

8
16:57:54,031 --> 16:58:20,646
there oh I can definitely see those swirls now and I work my way up to the mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater and I can really see that and so what I can see when I look in this mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater I can see that high point pretty in the center the rim of the crater is not very well defined

9
16:58:20,913 --> 16:58:23,296
but that mare pond is really well defined.

10
16:58:23,336 --> 16:58:28,663
And if I look in there, I can see some later sort of swirling also in there.

11
16:58:28,703 --> 16:58:33,869
There is the crater that is about the six o'clock position of that mare pond.

12
16:58:34,089 --> 16:58:38,995
And, um, and a little bit above that, it's almost like an upside down octopus.

13
16:58:39,516 --> 16:58:42,139
Uh, you can sort of see some of that coloring.

14
16:58:42,800 --> 16:58:47,005
It looks like the mare pond sort of flows around the

15
16:58:50,191 --> 16:58:58,819
It flows around the peak inside.

16
16:58:59,180 --> 16:59:00,721
Why can't I think of that word right now?

17
16:59:01,342 --> 16:59:05,326
And it has that little offshoot to the right from there.

18
16:59:06,066 --> 16:59:11,392
Okay, so I'm definitely going to go try to look for that scarp right now.

19
16:59:11,412 --> 16:59:16,857
I can see, almost looks like you can see those little swirls.

20
16:59:17,596 --> 16:59:20,460
Let me see if I can maybe draw those in a second too.

21
16:59:21,442 --> 16:59:25,528
But if I'm looking for that scarp, it is.

22
16:59:25,548 --> 16:59:37,926
It looks like that scarp is sort of bisecting the crater next to it.

23
16:59:37,946 --> 16:59:39,428
So I go there.

24
16:59:40,670 --> 16:59:46,438
I go across to this crater and see if I can

25
16:59:46,739 --> 16:59:48,321
Resolve that scarp.

26
16:59:48,981 --> 16:59:52,745
I think that is the one.

27
16:59:52,765 --> 16:59:53,706
There.

28
16:59:55,748 --> 16:59:56,729
Okay, again.

29
16:59:56,769 --> 17:00:00,313
It's very...

30
17:00:01,754 --> 17:00:03,716
I'm taking images of where it is.

31
17:00:03,736 --> 17:00:07,320
It's very hard for me to resolve that right now in the light.

32
17:00:08,041 --> 17:00:12,105
But I'm following the craters that it would be bisecting there.

33
17:00:13,638 --> 17:00:23,271
But it really isn't popping out as evident without like some of the shadows that would make it pop out a little bit more if it were closer to the Terminator than it actually is.

34
17:00:24,573 --> 17:00:29,019
And so I really can't see any of that tectonic activity there.

35
17:00:35,388 --> 17:00:41,316
But it is worth looking for and hopefully, I wish we could definitely have seen that for you all.

36
17:00:43,574 --> 17:00:45,568
Um, let's see.
