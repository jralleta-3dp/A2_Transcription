16:11:01,398 --> 16:11:02,620
Okay, Kelsey back with you.

2
16:11:02,660 --> 16:11:04,843
It's 1607 here.

3
16:11:04,863 --> 16:11:07,848
And my next target is a high priority target.

4
16:11:08,108 --> 16:11:09,911
It is Oppenheimer Basin Basin.

5
16:11:10,472 --> 16:11:12,134
Let's see what I'm looking for here.

6
16:11:12,174 --> 16:11:13,997
I'll orient myself.

7
16:11:15,499 --> 16:11:19,566
Let's see, I see again Aiken Crater's been such a helpful guidepost for me.

8
16:11:19,646 --> 16:11:25,735
So I'm coming down to make sure I hit it.

9
16:11:28,415 --> 16:11:30,818
And wow, this one's a little hard to see as well.

10
16:11:31,018 --> 16:11:36,505
I do see Apollo Basin and it almost seems like Oppenheimer Basin is obscured.

11
16:11:36,565 --> 16:11:47,619
Let's see here by a, let's see, by a bright crater ray that's coming down from the direction of Crookes Crater.

12
16:11:47,639 --> 16:11:52,245
I see in the geography review Oppenheimer Basin should be just to the left.

13
16:11:52,630 --> 16:11:57,461
of that beautiful bright crater ray from Crooks that is totally dominating my field of view here.

14
16:11:57,481 --> 16:12:05,819
And I have to say, this is a challenging one to be able to identify, but I know how important it is to you guys.

15
16:12:05,879 --> 16:12:08,665
So I'll give it my best shot here.

16
16:12:09,185 --> 16:12:20,135
Looking at Oppenheimer Basin, to me with the naked eye, it looks like just an area where there's several smaller craters that are sort of nearby to each other.

17
16:12:20,195 --> 16:12:34,449
The smallest of which in my lunar targeting plan in the screenshot there, I see the tiniest, darkest crater in the LTP is also the darkest feature to my naked eye as well.

18
16:12:35,650 --> 16:12:39,073
It's hard for me to see morphology, honestly,

19
16:12:39,492 --> 16:12:46,581
because of the illumination angle, it's really the albedo that's popping out to me more than anything.

20
16:12:46,661 --> 16:12:53,329
So as for shape and size, it's a challenge to sort of pick that out.

21
16:12:53,369 --> 16:13:09,229
But I guess as I'm looking at it longer, I'm starting to see, I'm tilting my head to the right and I sort of start to see almost like a little face that's made by just eyes and a nose, a little face of three darker mare patches

22
16:13:09,496 --> 16:13:11,699
that are in close proximity to one another.

23
16:13:11,739 --> 16:13:24,435
As for the sense of scale, let me look at my scale bar here on the targeting plan, and it looks like the darkest of those patches is probably, oh, I don't know, 40 to 50 kilometers across.

24
16:13:25,316 --> 16:13:39,013
As for what I'm supposed to be looking at, which is basin structures in the fractured floor, I mean, I guess the only insight I can provide in terms of the question about pyroplastics is that

25
16:13:39,263 --> 16:13:49,277
darkest patch that's kind of like in in the 10 o'clock area if Oppenheimer Basin Basin were a clock with north as 12 o'clock is that that is more irregular.

26
16:13:49,317 --> 16:13:59,952
It appears to be not totally infilling an impact crater but rather its own unique patch with sort of rougher non-circular edges to it.

27
16:14:00,914 --> 16:14:03,297
I see here that I'm supposed to compare

28
16:14:03,698 --> 16:14:31,022
this to looking at similar deposits with Apollo which is I know the next target but I'll just say while I'm giving this target here that the darker patch in Apollo Basin is similarly irregularly shaped and so it again appears like perhaps similar processes formed them or at least that that's an interpretation but they do look similarly irregular.

29
16:14:31,702 --> 16:14:32,743
I will say

30
16:14:33,803 --> 16:14:48,082
The picture in the LTP is a little misleading because it makes it look like that, again, that crater at like 10 o'clock, if Oppenheimer Basin were a clock, is much more circular and distinct than what I'm actually able to see with my naked eye here.

31
16:14:49,404 --> 16:14:57,996
So the best I can really provide to you is a look at color and sort of distinctness of the boundary of the feature.

32
16:14:58,737 --> 16:15:02,562
Hard for me to tell spatially, which is younger or older,

33
16:15:02,744 --> 16:15:09,697
If you had to make me guess, I'd say that it appears to be sitting on top of a lot of surrounding features in the area.

34
16:15:09,737 --> 16:15:17,833
And I'll see if I can make some annotations in the OneNote, because I know how important this target is to you guys.
