1
16:38:03,068 --> 16:38:04,690
Alright, it is Marie.

2
16:38:05,030 --> 16:38:06,912
I just got back into the seat.

3
16:38:07,152 --> 16:38:10,977
I'm going to try to look along the exosphere.

4
16:38:11,357 --> 16:38:15,301
Just sort of look and see if I can see any light coming up.

5
16:38:15,662 --> 16:38:20,447
So I have the camera in window 3 and window 2.

6
16:38:21,028 --> 16:38:22,369
The one without the cab cam.

7
16:38:22,649 --> 16:38:24,191
The one where I should be with my camera.

8
16:38:25,312 --> 16:38:30,578
So I'm going to start looking along the limbs here.

9
16:38:30,946 --> 16:38:33,008
I think Earth is going to be coming from.

10
16:38:34,910 --> 16:38:38,534
Looking to see if I can... oh my camera isn't on.

11
16:38:38,554 --> 16:38:39,415
My camera is on.

12
16:38:39,495 --> 16:38:43,259
We're still doing a little picture wise.

13
16:38:43,279 --> 16:38:45,781
We got our new card inside.

14
16:38:46,702 --> 16:38:58,995
That is card 1029 is in my slot 1.

15
16:39:01,372 --> 16:39:26,907
so i can actually now getting organized here so i'm going to be looking along the the rim and the exosphere trying to look and see if i can see any evidence i don't really see too much right now this looks a little bit fuzzy but it's it is hard because we know the Earth will be coming up from behind

16
16:39:27,663 --> 16:39:50,633
an area that is in darkness so it's still really hard but if I look at the disappearing limb taking some images as I look at that as well just going up and down oh I could see a little spot of something off in the distance there and that's very interesting a little white spot off of the limb

17
16:39:51,254 --> 16:40:04,727
I'm not really sure what that is but it's sort of like coming over from Jackson, halfway between Jackson, like following that about the 430 ray down.

18
16:40:04,767 --> 16:40:07,493
It goes towards where that little light area is.

19
16:40:08,075 --> 16:40:09,398
So that's the end of my...
