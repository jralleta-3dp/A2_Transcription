15:27:04,081 --> 15:27:10,531
Okay, so I am now going back to my Lunar Targeting Package for number 9, Mari Inchnai.

2
15:27:11,312 --> 15:27:16,139
This is also the first of two observations for this target.

3
15:27:16,960 --> 15:27:25,833
And so I am looking at some of the color, albedo, and texture variations, working to get some images.

4
15:27:25,894 --> 15:27:33,565
And interesting to sort of look for, I know there are some swirls in this target, so I'm going to be looking for those there.

5
15:27:34,372 --> 15:27:36,936
And so once again, I have the camera in my hand.

6
15:27:38,137 --> 15:27:42,303
I can see Mare Ingenii.

7
15:27:42,323 --> 15:27:53,899
Let me see.

8
15:27:53,999 --> 15:27:56,122
And so I can see the Apollo there.

9
15:27:56,322 --> 15:27:57,804
And now there's Leibniz.

10
15:27:57,824 --> 15:27:59,907
And so I can see Leibniz.

11
15:28:00,680 --> 15:28:05,807
I can see Mare Ingenii there, so I've been able to locate it now.

12
15:28:07,089 --> 15:28:10,734
And so I'm going to work on getting a full zoomed in image here.

13
15:28:10,754 --> 15:28:24,192
Yeah, so it's definitely a little bit hard to actually see some of the swirls that are in there.

14
15:28:24,212 --> 15:28:27,497
I can see some of the terraced edges.

15
15:28:27,730 --> 15:28:30,554
It's because it's right there on the limb right now.

16
15:28:30,594 --> 15:28:49,644
It's sort of difficult to see some of those swirls and so I'm trying to make some good observations so when I come back around the next time that I could see these a little bit better.

17
15:28:50,826 --> 15:28:52,168
Let's see.

18
15:28:52,621 --> 15:28:56,405
I'm looking through the camera to compare some of the size here.

19
15:28:56,445 --> 15:28:57,467
It's about the same.

20
15:28:57,507 --> 15:29:00,911
That sort of mare material is very similar too.

21
15:29:00,951 --> 15:29:05,616
It's like the three feet across from Apollo to Leibniz.

22
15:29:05,636 --> 15:29:10,542
It's about also the size of the crater in Leibniz.

23
15:29:12,364 --> 15:29:16,729
I'm looking for some of that bright spot that you can sort of see.

24
15:29:16,749 --> 15:29:19,472
So it looks like, oh, I think I can see a swirl.

25
15:29:20,093 --> 15:29:22,677
Let me get a picture focused on that right now.

26
15:29:29,809 --> 15:29:33,535
And so, you can tell that Mare Anginae right there.

27
15:29:33,555 --> 15:29:41,067
It's sort of that part of the core, like if you think of it like an eyeball, you can sort of see some of those veininess.

28
15:29:41,568 --> 15:29:46,135
It's sort of like the Mare Anginae is divided into like the two separate spots.

29
15:29:47,549 --> 15:29:50,433
And so there's the top part and the bottom part.

30
15:29:50,493 --> 15:29:53,617
I can see the bottom part has a little bit of swirls.

31
15:29:54,097 --> 15:29:58,182
They fit about right in the square of my focus.

32
15:29:59,564 --> 15:30:04,550
So I can see on the limb right there.

33
15:30:04,590 --> 15:30:07,534
I think we're going to get a better view of these when we come back.

34
15:30:08,555 --> 15:30:12,700
But really interested for what those are looking at right now.

35
15:30:12,800 --> 15:30:14,923
But what I want to compare is the color.

36
15:30:15,359 --> 15:30:23,112
The color that I am seeing inside of Mare Ingenii, it is a little bit darker than the Mare that you're seeing in Leibniz.

37
15:30:23,673 --> 15:30:31,647
A little bit closer the color that you're seeing in the middle of Apollo, so I'm going to try to get an image with all of those in there right now.

38
15:30:31,667 --> 15:30:34,131
And so we can see between the two.

39
15:30:34,151 --> 15:30:37,857
Looking at the boundaries there.

40
15:30:40,537 --> 15:30:41,839
heavy and mungy.

41
15:30:42,700 --> 15:30:53,513
It's sort of, parts of it, like around the bottom of that top part of Mare Injani, it does sort of have that sharp, that sharp edge there.

42
15:30:54,013 --> 15:31:10,273
And then along the top part, as you get towards the brighter, like those brighter craters, sort of above the Mare, that sort of is a much more of a gradational boundary that you can see there.

43
15:31:10,810 --> 15:31:20,078
It looks like some of the ejecta from those tiny craters might come on top of the mare there as well.

44
15:31:21,299 --> 15:31:23,782
It's really hard to see any structures in here.

45
15:31:23,802 --> 15:31:32,289
Right now as I sort of, though it's a little bit on the limb, I'm really struggling to see any terraced features.

46
15:31:32,409 --> 15:31:36,353
I can see the rim, like the inner peak ring, sort of coming up.

47
15:31:37,234 --> 15:31:38,775
And it almost looks like the

48
15:31:40,443 --> 15:31:41,787
It's like a breached wall.

49
15:31:42,128 --> 15:31:51,595
You know, it looks like some of the Mario material sort of breached underneath, sort of that raised rim-like feature there.

50
15:31:53,741 --> 15:31:55,887
Alright, I think that's going to be the end of this one.
