1
17:26:03,608 --> 17:26:07,794
All right, starting high priority target number 26, Muscovians Basin.

2
17:26:09,096 --> 17:26:14,643
Specifically going to center some images and capture that entire basin.

3
17:26:14,703 --> 17:26:16,846
Might make it a few little mosaics of it.

4
17:26:17,367 --> 17:26:20,952
It's really starting to pop now as it comes closer to the Terminator.

5
17:26:21,032 --> 17:26:24,697
So this is great lighting conditions to capture it.

6
17:26:25,458 --> 17:26:33,109
Definitely can give you guys some words on the structure, texture, and variations of any color and albedo.

7
17:26:33,562 --> 17:26:37,406
And I'm going to keep a close eye out for lava flows.

8
17:26:38,047 --> 17:26:40,269
The basin rim right now is really starting to pop.

9
17:26:40,289 --> 17:26:44,433
So hopefully those come across in the images and any swirls.

10
17:26:44,734 --> 17:26:49,999
So lots to look at for, lots to look out for in Muscovian basin.

11
17:26:50,600 --> 17:26:56,446
And I'll double check that I've captured any notes after I start shooting some pictures here.

12
17:26:56,486 --> 17:27:02,472
So I might go quiet for a little bit as I capture some Muscovians.

13
17:27:03,717 --> 17:27:04,899
glamour shots here.

14
17:27:16,857 --> 17:27:27,293
Okay, at the highest resolution, so at 400, I can capture all of Muscovian's ring structure with a little bit of the Terminator in there.

15
17:27:27,313 --> 17:27:31,800
And so I'm gonna capture a couple photos

16
17:27:36,050 --> 17:27:52,432
a couple 20 or so in different orientations, different things in the frame of the photo for context.

17
17:27:52,572 --> 17:28:01,804
So a couple with the limb in there or with the Terminator, sorry, in there and a couple with the limb in there.

18
17:28:03,995 --> 17:28:05,897
Again, all at 400 millimeters.

19
17:28:07,359 --> 17:28:09,062
Now I'm gonna do a quick little mosaic.

20
17:28:13,708 --> 17:28:15,590
About 75% overlap.

21
17:28:26,884 --> 17:28:29,648
Realizing I'm doing an east-west snake.

22
17:28:30,860 --> 17:28:36,526
Probably should have done a north-south one given the Terminator conditions right now, but shouldn't matter too much.

23
17:28:38,729 --> 17:28:49,160
Okay, so there's a mosaic in there at 400 millimeter, that east-west snake across Muscovians, a tier of three from north to south.

24
17:28:55,167 --> 17:28:59,972
Again, using the camera lens kind of as a binocular now, or a monocular,

25
17:29:00,880 --> 17:29:13,894
I can maybe see some really nice terminations of the mare, you know, the lava coming up against some of the rim structure to the west side of Muscovians.

26
17:29:16,156 --> 17:29:21,321
Specifically, starting around the one o'clock to four o'clock.

27
17:29:22,242 --> 17:29:24,264
Seems like it comes the closest to the rim there.

28
17:29:24,304 --> 17:29:29,790
Take a few more photos.

29
17:29:38,410 --> 17:29:48,383
Really concentrating on trying to keep the camera steady, take out any shakes and not cram the camera too much into the window while I'm doing this.

30
17:29:52,068 --> 17:30:02,702
Albedo wise, the highest albedo is right at the crater rim at the, I'll say 1030.

31
17:30:04,564 --> 17:30:07,708
Between 10 and 11 o'clock is the highest albedo on the crater rim.

32
17:30:08,178 --> 17:30:14,825
The darkest albedo is at the base of the crater about one o'clock.

33
17:30:14,865 --> 17:30:25,015
There's a crater down there that's at two o'clock that's right around there seems to be the darkest part of that mare patch.

34
17:30:25,936 --> 17:30:28,719
Everything else is a couple of tones of gray in between.

35
17:30:28,759 --> 17:30:36,987
Didn't see any distinct colors other than shades of gray at this time.

36
17:30:37,692 --> 17:30:42,299
I'm taking a quick look at the LTP and allow my eyes to adjust back inside of the cabinet.

37
17:30:43,541 --> 17:30:56,239
So I definitely got a good centered images, captured the entire basin, captured the basin with some different things in context, and also a small little mosaic there.

38
17:30:57,581 --> 17:31:04,071
I'm not going to make any annotation here because I didn't see any

39
17:31:04,388 --> 17:31:09,338
strong color difference and I hopefully described the albedo context best I could.

40
17:31:10,380 --> 17:31:16,433
But I want to keep my hands on the camera here and get on to the next image and close out strong.

41
17:31:17,435 --> 17:31:20,541
So that's it for target number 26.
