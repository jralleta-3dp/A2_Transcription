1
14:38:02,579 --> 14:38:04,501
All right, back with you on target 22.

2
14:38:04,981 --> 14:38:11,848
Now back over into the window number two with the camera and the long lens.

3
14:38:12,629 --> 14:38:16,793
And so just taking a look now and getting set up, but I'm gonna leave the audio on.

4
14:38:17,494 --> 14:38:20,937
So forget a few little ramblings here as I get set up on target 22.

5
14:38:21,118 --> 14:38:29,806
So I'm looking for that crater region and luckily have the long lens to help me get there.

6
14:38:29,826 --> 14:38:32,569
So gonna,

7
14:38:34,928 --> 14:38:36,650
index off of Jackson.

8
14:38:36,710 --> 14:38:42,415
Make sure that it's about in line with the southern part of Muscovian Basin.

9
14:38:43,616 --> 14:38:51,004
Again, forgive my rambling here as I make sure that I'm getting the right target and the right focal length.

10
14:38:51,044 --> 14:38:57,190
So it looks like you want highest focal length surrounding dark plains and central images of the region.

11
14:38:57,370 --> 14:39:02,775
So I'm gonna make sure that I've got the right

12
14:39:04,156 --> 14:39:31,564
Target, I think I've got the right target because I See a distinct darker region in that that I can pick up off the 200 milliliter 200 millimeter image in the lunar targeting package, so gonna go ahead and start with a Center image and work my way in with that focal length all the way to the highest so first image and

13
14:39:32,843 --> 14:39:40,931
is gonna capture both Jackson and Muscovian basins and work my way into what I believe that crater is.

14
14:39:40,951 --> 14:39:46,656
And I can really start to pick up that darker region.

15
14:39:47,096 --> 14:39:52,361
Really appreciate the camera now after trying to view some things with the naked eye.

16
14:39:53,723 --> 14:39:59,408
And so I'm gonna do that whole sequence of images again, working my way in.

17
14:40:01,278 --> 14:40:14,993
with the camera slowly changing the zoom lens but keeping the central focus spot in the same area.

18
14:40:15,013 --> 14:40:23,462
This looks like it's, just double checking where my next highest priority target is, Muscovian Basin, so looks like I'm good, so I'm gonna take a few more shots.

19
14:40:26,565 --> 14:40:29,108
Trying to keep at the highest

20
14:40:33,172 --> 14:40:39,061
focal length and kind of surround that area with a number of images.

21
14:40:40,463 --> 14:40:48,675
Changing a little bit the camera orientation relative to the window of Orion to just make sure I get some glare out of there.

22
14:40:48,695 --> 14:40:54,083
And double checking my shroud to make sure I don't have any light seeping in.

23
14:41:01,910 --> 14:41:10,622
Capturing a few good images of that area, the target 22 area with Jackson also in frame.

24
14:41:10,662 --> 14:41:16,390
It allows you to trace from Jackson to that area via some of the rays.

25
14:41:22,198 --> 14:41:31,731
And one last image zoomed out to capture both the Earth and Moon as it currently

26
14:41:33,061 --> 14:41:39,431
is oriented out window two and I'm just going to do another series with the camera oriented in vertical.

27
14:41:44,919 --> 14:41:56,977
It's a little bit harder to stabilize the camera in vertical but does give you a little bit more north-south extent.

28
14:41:59,321 --> 14:42:02,325
Man, Earth is beautiful out there so I'm just going to take a picture of

29
14:42:03,740 --> 14:42:07,425
a few pictures of Earth while we have the opportunity.

30
14:42:13,272 --> 14:42:30,433
Okay, a few bonus pictures of Earth there at the end, but I'm gonna close out.

31
14:42:31,575 --> 14:42:32,616
Target 22.

32
14:42:33,507 --> 14:42:35,097
and move on to Jackson.
