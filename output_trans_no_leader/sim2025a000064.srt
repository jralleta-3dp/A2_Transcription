1
15:21:02,765 --> 15:21:06,590
All right, I'm starting Sudman Crater, target number seven.

2
15:21:07,591 --> 15:21:11,677
Taking a look now for locating it on the limb just above Oriental.

3
15:21:12,258 --> 15:21:17,264
This one's definitely at the extent of the human eye.

4
15:21:18,546 --> 15:21:28,840
I can't for say, using the LDP, flipping back and forth, that I for sure am seeing Sudman, target number seven.

5
15:21:29,748 --> 15:21:43,361
There is a few white specks out there above Apollo Basin that I can try to index off of, but really hard to pick up Sudman for sure.

6
15:21:44,122 --> 15:21:46,164
So let me just try to index again.

7
15:21:46,184 --> 15:21:48,726
I see the Apollo ring.

8
15:21:48,766 --> 15:21:57,274
I'm just not 100% sure as I zoom in on the LDP and flip my eyes back and forth.

9
15:21:58,300 --> 15:22:02,064
Um, that I am indeed being able to pick up Sundman J Crater.

10
15:22:02,144 --> 15:22:10,433
So, um, hopefully Marie's picking that up in the camera, um, at the highest focal length that she can.

11
15:22:10,453 --> 15:22:18,561
Uh, there is a lot of albedo little specks of white and kind of a medium gray field out there.

12
15:22:18,581 --> 15:22:24,107
Not a lot of topography is picking up in these illumination conditions, except for that rim of Apollo.

13
15:22:24,887 --> 15:22:27,430
Um, and.

14
15:22:28,895 --> 15:22:29,957
I'm sorry, Oriental.

15
15:22:29,997 --> 15:22:33,301
So every time I said Apollo previously, it's Orientale Basin.

16
15:22:33,402 --> 15:22:45,119
So just right above Orientale Basin, just that field of speckled white in that medium gray and just not able to pick out Sudman for sure.

17
15:22:45,159 --> 15:22:51,568
The rays of one of the crater in there maybe are a little distinct.

18
15:22:52,049 --> 15:22:54,773
So, but I don't think it's Sudman.

19
15:22:54,813 --> 15:22:58,378
I think it's more towards Ohms Crater and

20
15:22:59,067 --> 15:23:05,550
Yeah, with that I'm going to close out target number 7 and move to 8 just because I'm not 100% sure that I'm seeing Sudman.
