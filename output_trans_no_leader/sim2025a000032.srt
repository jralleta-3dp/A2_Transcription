1
16:47:00,031 --> 16:47:01,313
start on Ryder Crater.

2
16:47:01,413 --> 16:47:07,845
I got really distracted during Earthrise and so I'm gonna get going on this one right now.

3
16:47:08,406 --> 16:47:17,421
I can see it's down along the southern, the southern limb and the South Poleaitken Basin Acon and so I'm using this again Marie.

4
16:47:17,642 --> 16:47:22,470
I'm looking for Ryder with my camera along the southern rim.

5
16:47:22,691 --> 16:47:24,013
I'm looking to see

6
16:47:30,001 --> 16:47:33,625
So it's definitely sort of hard to pick this one out.

7
16:47:33,785 --> 16:47:42,754
So I have this high albedo spot that I'm looking for here.

8
16:47:42,794 --> 16:47:52,284
I don't have too much time, so it should be, I can see where, Teosca, is that what there?

9
16:47:52,565 --> 16:47:58,451
Okay, I can see the peak right next to it there, and I can see their bright spot now.

10
16:47:58,491 --> 16:47:59,552
I found that peak.

11
16:48:00,055 --> 16:48:06,704
I found that bright spot, so I'm going to zoom in and get some good images there of that area.

12
16:48:07,945 --> 16:48:14,234
Let's see how that, looking at that with the rest of the South Poleaitken Basin Aiken Basin area.

13
16:48:16,336 --> 16:48:21,383
And so, yeah, I can see exactly that crater with the peak ring.

14
16:48:25,128 --> 16:48:28,392
So I'm really looking to see if I can see that bright spot

15
16:48:28,810 --> 16:48:34,155
The brightness is not standing out as much as I would have expected right now.

16
16:48:37,399 --> 16:48:39,301
So that is sort of surprising.

17
16:48:39,321 --> 16:48:41,823
It's not surprising because it's right on the Terminator there.

18
16:48:42,584 --> 16:48:44,806
So that brightness didn't really help me find it.

19
16:48:44,907 --> 16:48:46,648
More of the morphology did.

20
16:48:48,090 --> 16:48:50,632
So making sure that I'm in the right spot.

21
16:48:51,974 --> 16:48:57,079
There's the two double right above it and then the mare.

22
16:48:57,548 --> 16:49:00,352
So I definitely got some images of that material there.

23
16:49:01,514 --> 16:49:04,518
But really cannot see any of those ejector rays.

24
16:49:05,419 --> 16:49:09,184
And looking for...

25
16:49:09,285 --> 16:49:14,091
There's definitely... Yeah, it's definitely slightly lighter.

26
16:49:15,373 --> 16:49:20,420
But really hard to just pick out much more of that texture of that small area besides like...

27
16:49:21,001 --> 16:49:23,124
Sort of looks like a dome-y material.

28
16:49:24,266 --> 16:49:27,370
Sort of raised a little bit.

29
16:49:28,227 --> 16:49:30,495
Slightly lighter than the area around it.

30
16:49:30,515 --> 16:49:33,525
Is that a volcano cone right there?

31
16:49:33,545 --> 16:49:35,773
Probably not, but pretty interesting.
