There it is.

15:35:50,643 --> 15:35:54,950
It's sort of around the 2 o'clock on the rim.

6
15:35:55,090 --> 15:35:58,675
I can still see that the edge is a little bit hazier.

7
15:35:59,026 --> 15:36:06,143
And maybe we should do the changeover, because it looks like they need a little bit of assistance here in the reconfiguration time.

15:36:06,905 --> 15:36:10,453
Yep.
