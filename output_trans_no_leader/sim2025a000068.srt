1
16:37:02,275 --> 16:37:04,839
All right, we're back with you in window three.

2
16:37:05,500 --> 16:37:14,573
We just did a successful switch over to have a little chat with the outgoing shift, and they're going to send up a sign set up here in a little bit.

3
16:37:14,593 --> 16:37:31,557
But I'm going to start with the exosphere dust get ahead target, target delta, because I see a little bit of a phenomena that's happening right on the Terminator, just proximal to

4
16:37:31,874 --> 16:37:32,715
Muscovy Ents.

5
16:37:32,795 --> 16:37:39,202
So I'm going to go ahead and try to describe that while I draw a little diagram of that area.

6
16:37:39,543 --> 16:37:53,779
So I'm looking at Muscovy Ents and if I go 10 o'clock towards the limb, the dark limb from there, I'm seeing a little bit of color change along that horizon.

7
16:37:53,819 --> 16:38:01,307
It's like a slight glare, but I could convince myself that it's maybe a little bit of

8
16:38:01,962 --> 16:38:10,115
phenomena of dust lofting or some kind of exospheric phenomena that my eye is picking up only in that area.

9
16:38:10,155 --> 16:38:19,910
I've looked along the entire Terminator from north to south, and that's the only area that I see that popping out at me.

10
16:38:19,950 --> 16:38:30,366
So I'm going to go ahead and end this audio for that delta exosphere get ahead target and try to get some of that annotated in the OneNote.
