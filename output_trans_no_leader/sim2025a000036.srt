1
17:08:01,448 --> 17:08:03,431
All right, so I am getting ready.

2
17:08:03,451 --> 17:08:04,793
Now I am back.

3
17:08:05,174 --> 17:08:11,004
I am over in the, in window three that has CapCam 2.

4
17:08:11,444 --> 17:08:16,673
I'm now just focusing on my observations, not with the camera anymore.

5
17:08:17,334 --> 17:08:21,821
So it's so nice when you're able to zoom in so much.

6
17:08:21,921 --> 17:08:26,629
And now I'm back to looking at it as a whole and looking at the entire complete disk is still really

7
17:08:27,065 --> 17:08:28,146
really need to see.

8
17:08:28,447 --> 17:08:32,031
So I'm going to go and be looking for By's Ballot.

9
17:08:32,952 --> 17:08:35,315
It is up by Jackson Crater.

10
17:08:35,355 --> 17:08:40,721
So I can see Jackson there.

11
17:08:40,961 --> 17:08:45,206
I can see where Lacus Luxury region is.

12
17:08:45,607 --> 17:08:47,789
And so then I'm looking for that.

13
17:08:48,490 --> 17:08:51,033
I know it's a weird shaped.

14
17:08:52,374 --> 17:08:55,418
Lacus Luxury is that dark spot, which I can see.

15
17:08:55,752 --> 17:08:57,994
which really helps me find Bai's ballot.

16
17:08:59,155 --> 17:09:04,560
And so I have been able to find it.

17
17:09:05,281 --> 17:09:08,564
And so I'm just looking with my eyes right now out the window.

18
17:09:09,244 --> 17:09:24,358
And so I can see this in the, it's the rays of Jackson sort of go all the way from the limb almost over to essentially just above

19
17:09:24,760 --> 17:09:48,355
Bayes-Ballot region and so the Bayes-Ballot I think it's just like 72 kilometers in diameter so it's a pretty small guy but the shape of it is definitely weird and so I can tell that shape sort of using the brightness of the

20
17:09:49,162 --> 17:09:50,924
of the wall of that crater.

21
17:09:51,384 --> 17:09:56,009
And so the brightness is much stronger on the western side than the eastern.

22
17:09:56,069 --> 17:10:01,054
And then underneath we have the Lackus Luxury region, which is a darker spot.

23
17:10:01,114 --> 17:10:14,548
That dark spot sort of looks like the, you know, when we found the parachute on the surface of Mars from the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, you can sort of see all the strings that held the rover.

24
17:10:14,648 --> 17:10:16,350
That's exactly what it looks like.

25
17:10:16,955 --> 17:10:25,689
And so the darkness of that looks similar to what we can see over at Muscovy and say there.

26
17:10:26,510 --> 17:10:31,177
The boundaries of that, they definitely sort of streak and it's gradational.

27
17:10:31,197 --> 17:10:42,355
It's much stronger in the center of that lattice luxury, but we don't see anything sort of a emitter like

28
17:10:42,790 --> 17:10:47,239
Well, now that I've sort of acclimated a little bit, I can see sort of a gray or brownish.

29
17:10:47,299 --> 17:10:53,331
So on the bottom, that looks very similar to the highlands material that is being overlaid by the Jackson Crater rays.

30
17:10:54,152 --> 17:10:59,182
And so I don't see too much else in that structure there.

31
17:10:59,202 --> 17:11:01,727
And I'm running out of time because we had to switch.

32
17:11:01,747 --> 17:11:03,330
So I'll finish this one up.
