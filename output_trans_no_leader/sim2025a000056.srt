1
14:52:02,714 --> 14:52:06,318
Starting the voice recording for target one, Whole Moon.

2
14:52:06,378 --> 14:52:12,886
We've just got visibility on the moon.

3
14:52:13,306 --> 14:52:17,111
And so target number one, taking a look at the observation actions.

4
14:52:18,232 --> 14:52:27,983
Now I'm gonna give you my general impression as I'm looking through the lens, as I'm capturing the Whole Moon with a mid-focus mosaic.

5
14:52:29,024 --> 14:52:31,287
Starting now with a north-south pattern.

6
14:52:31,705 --> 14:52:32,826
50% overlap.

7
14:52:45,402 --> 14:52:49,648
Coming down the limb of the moon to the left.

8
14:52:51,009 --> 14:52:55,475
Definitely could make out Muscovians very clearly in the lens.

9
14:52:58,258 --> 14:53:01,122
I'm having to concentrate on the snake pattern

10
14:53:02,333 --> 14:53:06,237
to get the 50% overlap and get high resolution images.

11
14:53:06,257 --> 14:53:08,559
Sure is beautiful.

12
14:53:08,619 --> 14:53:20,249
And getting really spectacular rays that my eye didn't pick up in the camera now that I'm zoomed in.

13
14:53:20,309 --> 14:53:27,436
Just completed the second pass on the snake.

14
14:53:30,018 --> 14:53:32,020
Again, very clear rays.

15
14:53:37,062 --> 14:53:42,527
Concentrating on the 50% overlap, so it might be a little choppy on my voice comm here.

16
14:53:45,750 --> 14:53:56,040
Near the southern part, I'm picking up a lot of the dark mari infill on some of those southern craters.

17
14:54:01,465 --> 14:54:06,630
Gonna give a quick look at my screen while I have a target to index off of.

18
14:54:07,538 --> 14:54:17,633
Targets look in focus on my D5 screen, so I'm gonna pick up on that target where I left off, continue the pattern up.

19
14:54:21,418 --> 14:54:23,681
Certainly feel like I'm getting 50% overlap.

20
14:54:29,570 --> 14:54:35,098
Overall, just concentrating on getting the mosaic well documented.

21
14:54:37,441 --> 14:54:40,245
before I make a few other observations through the lens.

22
14:54:48,798 --> 14:54:56,750
Picking up Apollo Basin now, beautiful in the resolution that I can see with this medium lens.

23
14:55:02,518 --> 14:55:03,820
Okay, struggling on the

24
14:55:06,888 --> 14:55:16,383
a limb that's to the three o'clock position out the window right now to just get the full mosaic and resolution.

25
14:55:18,246 --> 14:55:34,532
Camera's struggling a little bit on focusing, so I'm having to target the center of the moon or at least further in on the moon to get the far limb at three o'clock.

26
14:55:39,085 --> 14:55:50,315
Overall, I had the lens set at about 280, and taking a look at any other observation actions you want.

27
14:55:51,016 --> 14:56:03,788
So the biggest thing that stuck out to me as I took that mosaic was the colors of those rays, specifically up in kind of the northwestern quadrant.

28
14:56:04,448 --> 14:56:07,371
The albedo was a very stark difference

29
14:56:07,773 --> 14:56:10,100
through the lens versus what my eye could pick up.

30
14:56:11,083 --> 14:56:16,399
And the features across the globe are just spectacular and looking forward to getting into the next targets.
