Let me show you what's happening up here in the cabin.
There it is.
So I'm looking for Stephan L. Yeah, so looking for Stephan up there.
It's sort of around the 2 o'clock on the rim.
I can still see that the edge is a little bit hazier.
And maybe we should do the changeover, because it looks like they need a little bit of assistance here in the reconfiguration time.
Yep.
