1
15:01:03,727 --> 15:01:06,431
All right, starting target three, Orientale Basin.

2
15:01:06,811 --> 15:01:15,482
Looking for a mosaic of the entire feature, west to east snake pattern with 50% overlap with the highest focal length.

3
15:01:15,502 --> 15:01:18,426
So I'm at the 400 focal length.

4
15:01:18,887 --> 15:01:30,162
First off, I'm gonna take more of a context photo of Orientale Basin with the red square dead center, and then start that mosaic.

5
15:01:30,322 --> 15:01:32,805
So that should provide context for a mosaic.

6
15:01:34,709 --> 15:01:42,985
I'm almost gonna go for 75% overlap and really blast across the top of Oriental, west to east.

7
15:01:47,814 --> 15:01:48,616
Second pass.

8
15:01:54,727 --> 15:01:56,751
Across the center of Oriental.

9
15:02:03,785 --> 15:02:08,030
third pass across the bottom of Oriental.

10
15:02:10,752 --> 15:02:17,480
Had a couple camera fires there that only caught one or two images out of the three stack.

11
15:02:18,721 --> 15:02:27,210
And again, finishing off that target with a context photo at about mid-zoom level, about 200.

12
15:02:34,160 --> 15:02:36,643
So I see that's a high-priority target.

13
15:02:37,183 --> 15:02:41,128
It captured everything at least at 50% overlap.

14
15:02:41,708 --> 15:02:46,594
Saw a lot of the annular ring and ejecta structure as I was taking those photos.

15
15:02:47,214 --> 15:02:53,622
I'm also gonna make an annotation since that's a high-priority target with a wavefowl.

16
15:02:54,583 --> 15:02:58,607
Standby for that, but incredible target overall.

17
15:03:00,249 --> 15:03:03,913
The annular ring does start to pick up in that illumination condition.

18
15:03:04,400 --> 15:03:12,811
In fact, I'm going to take a few more photos just zoomed in right on the part dead center that I see the annular ring sticking up the most.

19
15:03:13,132 --> 15:03:15,315
That's kind of at the three o'clock position.

20
15:03:15,335 --> 15:03:18,419
Hip north is up the window north.

21
15:03:19,480 --> 15:03:25,228
Also some spectacular topography seen at the smaller craters that are in Oriental.

22
15:03:27,591 --> 15:03:31,757
And a really good contrast between the

23
15:03:32,412 --> 15:03:40,520
the darker regions at the base of Oriental, the darker rim of Oriental, kind of from the 12 o'clock to the three o'clock.

24
15:03:41,681 --> 15:03:46,005
And that topography really stands out, as I said, in this illumination condition.

25
15:03:49,268 --> 15:03:54,393
Took a few more zoomed in pictures that just capture the entirety of Oriental.

26
15:03:54,873 --> 15:03:58,977
I'm gonna try one using the camera in a vertical position.

27
15:04:04,272 --> 15:04:12,088
And I'm going to end the recording here and put an audio recording to mark that in the D5.
