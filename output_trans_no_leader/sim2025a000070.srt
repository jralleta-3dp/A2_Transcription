Okay, quick one on Ryder Crater, our target Foxtrot.

2
16:46:06,322 --> 16:46:10,147
Just running out of time and I want to make sure I get some of the higher priority targets.

3
16:46:10,168 --> 16:46:11,069
So this will be a quick one.

4
16:46:11,089 --> 16:46:17,418
I did take a long look at the LTP to make sure that I was able to train my eyes in on Ryder.

5
16:46:17,538 --> 16:46:25,330
And I think I've nailed it just below that larger crater that has a ring structure and a mare.

6
16:46:25,985 --> 16:46:34,037
I see Ryder pretty distinctly just given its higher albedo and some topography that's now popping out along the Terminator.

7
16:46:34,858 --> 16:46:47,436
And as I zoom in on the LTP and flip back and forth, I can definitely match up the two pretty similar diameter craters under the crater that is larger just above Ryder.

8
16:46:47,922 --> 16:46:49,465
and be able to trace that down.

9
16:46:50,426 --> 16:47:00,563
And then there's a similar three or four craters kind of in a square that allow me to pick up Ryder with the higher albedo of those four.

10
16:47:01,464 --> 16:47:14,385
Other than that, I can't say too much about Ryder other than it has that higher albedo visibly by my eye and it is really distinct.

11
16:47:15,952 --> 16:47:17,975
with some of the topography around there.

12
16:47:17,995 --> 16:47:25,765
Don't know how to explain it, but there's a very distinct topography, almost looks like deeper crater in that area.

13
16:47:26,586 --> 16:47:30,291
I think that's one just to the west of Ryder, the higher albedo one.

14
16:47:32,714 --> 16:47:44,490
As I zoom in, yeah, for sure, the one that looks like a deeper crater is to the west of Ryder, but there's a series of four craters there that make about the same diameters to each other.

15
16:47:44,842 --> 16:47:49,350
And rider is that higher albedo one, which my eye does pick up out the window.
