1
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:02,171
No, you had to.

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:03,872
Yeah, I'm gonna do a little voice recording.

3
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,692
So this is Christina Cook doing Earthrise site 21.

4
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:10,373
The exosphere just prior to Earthrise.

5
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,274
Oh, so that's good to know.

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:22,996
Seeing Earth come out of the darkened side of the moon was absolutely incredible.

7
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,216
The exosphere wasn't notable.

8
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,617
I didn't see any glow, like apparent glowing or

9
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:37,827
you know, raised particulates or levitated, you know, ion region or anything like that.

10
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:46,869
The colors of Earth look very bright as they popped out of the eclipse of the moon.

11
00:00:54,987 --> 00:01:03,518
the blues really stand out they're almost a deeper darker almost like a royal to aqua blue
