00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:06,416
Christina Cook annotating site 5, Sundman 5 crater.

2
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:17,161
We weren't able to 100% identify exactly this crater, but it does say the line of craters, so I'll describe the line of craters that is in this area near the limb.

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,343
Nothing distinctive on the limb itself, no views of the exosphere.

4
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:27,342
The craters themselves appear to be pretty new, just because they're very round.

5
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:33,647
They all are some of the smallest visible craters on the surface of the moon.

6
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:48,839
From the view looking at the moon with my eyes, I am not able to discern any one crater being deeper, more distinctive, or more shadowed than the others, as is evident on the photo in the lunar targeting plan.

7
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:51,137
So that's one thing to note.

8
00:00:51,878 --> 00:01:13,506
I do see a lot of distinctive dots in this area that are little dots of high albedo areas and what is otherwise a medium gray tones in an area that doesn't have a lot of mare, but also to the west of the big mare sort of field.

9
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:17,708
I'm also not able to make out a very distinctive line of craters in this particular area.

10
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:25,038
There are some lines of craters that all sort of follow lines of radiation out from ohm.

11
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:34,243
This one would be, if it were one of those at about the four o'clock position, I can see several other lines of craters that do appear like they're scattered from ohm.

12
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:42,407
Most of those lines of craters are equidistant apart and of the same albedo, each one of them in the same size.

13
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,248
If this one is from that line just

14
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,953
per the picture, it would be distinctive because of its clearer shape and depth.

15
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,835
But again, I'm not able to see that on the moon itself.

16
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,478
I don't see any differences in color in this area.

17
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:06,685
There could be a slight basin shape that is kind of inside the isosceles triangle of lighter areas here.

18
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:16,292
A circle that is about the height of the isosceles triangle, a little shorter, with its upper left quadrant being defined by a little dark

19
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,046
spot that appears to be Mario and not Shadow.

20
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:21,597
That's all I'm going to say about that.
