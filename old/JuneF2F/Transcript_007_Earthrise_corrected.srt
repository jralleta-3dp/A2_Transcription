00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:25,316

00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,438
This is what we've been waiting for!

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,999
And look out the window!

9
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:35,201
It's, it's everything right... there.

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,382
Wow.

11
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:38,463
A beauty!

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,684
That's, that's something special.

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,245
That's, that's pretty breathtaking.

14
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,826
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take a moment.

15
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:47,627
Yeah, wow.

16
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,648
Take a look at that.

17
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:50,799
Alright, I'm doing it.

18
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm blocking it out with my thumb.

19
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,026
It's an honor, guys.

20
00:00:57,106 --> 00:01:04,855
There's really no one I'd rather be here right now in this moment than with you guys.

21
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:05,976
Back at ya.

22
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:09,394
Trevor, stop what you're doing over there.

23
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:10,095
Stop being productive.

24
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,537
Come on over and take a look at this.

25
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:13,760
All right, all right.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,282
Okay, I'll start to describe.

27
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:23,953
Yeah, I'm seeing the, oh, it's just, it's hard to do the science, but I'm looking at something so special.

28
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,635
Yeah, I'm seeing the blues.

29
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:28,399
Dark and light blues.

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,561
The white's really standing out.

31
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,524
Hi, Antarctica!

32
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,607
Earth's South Pole looks pretty great from over here.

33
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,851
Oh, I can see you guys, Houston.

34
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,955
See those swirls of clouds.

35
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,236
South America.

36
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,205
Oh, don't worry, Earth.

37
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,867
I'm getting pictures of all your good angles.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,068
You're looking great from here, Houston.

39
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:55,488
Oh, all right.

40
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:58,069
And now I take a full Earth.

41
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,489
So mark this time.

42
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:00,110
That's when the...

43
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,707
I can see it all.

44
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:07,429
There's no more shadow of the moon on the Earth.

45
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,671
So that's pretty crazy.

46
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,112
Space has never looked so black from over here.

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:20,057
So yes, Earth is coming right above or north of the equator or the equatorial line.

48
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:23,559
So like if north is 12 o'clock, we're looking at like 930.

49
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,321
Man, the Earth looks so smooth.

50
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,895
It looks peaceful from here, doesn't it?

51
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,015
It really does.

52
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:36,657
And the far side of the moon looks pretty rough compared to just how smooth and beautiful the Earth is.

53
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm feeling like the luckiest person, not on Earth, luckiest person around the moon right now.

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,821
Yeah, I can see it all, Houston.

55
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,221
I'm starting to feel a little homesick.

56
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,983
But yeah, I'm looking through my camera lens.

57
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,249
See a little bit more detail for you guys.

58
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,393
I can see the greens and the browns.

59
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,398
See Amazon rainforests.

60
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,780
Maybe those are the Andes.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,841
Maybe those are the Andes.

62
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,315
Absolutely gorgeous.

63
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,337
Angela's got some good pictures here.

64
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:09,899
Hey, mark this up.

65
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,902
This is definitely the first one that we're going to have to send down back to Earth.

66
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:16,386
People are going to want to see these pictures as soon as we can.

67
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,248
So prep yourself, Houston.

68
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:21,191
You've got some beautiful shots coming down.

69
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,873
I can't wait to tell you all about it.

70
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,395
Oh my god.

71
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,135
I could cry.
