00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,043
Alright, this is Andre Douglas.

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:04,924
I'm at Target 7 here.

3
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,105
We're looking at Oum.

4
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:10,026
Oum is to the northwest of Orientale right now.

5
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:17,589
It is a fairly big crater and it has a bunch of streaks that radiate outward.

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:29,014
I would say mostly from the 2 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position to the southeast and then more from the 11 o'clock back to the 7 o'clock counterclockwise.

7
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,970
from the northwest to the southwest, almost like a butterfly pattern.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,372
Over in the 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock, there's not really many rays.

9
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:44,914
There's a dark field of regolith out there that is somewhat, I would say, medium gray.

10
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:56,519
And as we're approaching the crater from the outside, I see a ring of dark gray terrain that is really highlighting the rim of the crater.

11
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,420
And it comes in and is slightly sharp,

12
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:11,619
as we go up and over the crater, and then walking in down towards the center, it goes to a brighter white with some albedo there, then another light ring of gray, and then a white center.

13
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,600
So it kind of has a bullseye effect.

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:25,545
And then in the center area, that overall whiteness albedo is not as white as another patch that is about five diameters to the

15
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,545
I would say 7 o'clock position or southwest position from OM.

16
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:33,205
There's another white albedo patch that doesn't look like a crater, but just a patch.

17
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:37,246
But inside OM is much grayer than that, but still it's a light gray.

18
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:41,967
So it's not necessarily the freshest impact there.

19
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:53,089
And I would say there's more of a whiter plane on the south side of OM, and then again, a darker gray on the north side of OM.

20
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,186
And that's all I have for that.
