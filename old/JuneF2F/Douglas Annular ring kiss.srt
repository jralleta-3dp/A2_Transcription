1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:07,270
All right, this is Andre, and I'm doing my target six.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,630
This is the Oriental annular ring.

3
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:17,012
As I'm looking at Oriental, I'm at the, oh, thank you.

4
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:29,536
Cool.

5
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:34,427
All right, so for Oriental, I have it identified.

6
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:38,229
It's got the outer ring and the inner ring.

7
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,310
There is a dark mare in the middle.

8
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,811
It's a dark gray overall.

9
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:46,732
There's some shades of lighter gray as well.

10
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:54,016
And then on the 7 and 8 o'clock position of Orientale, I see the annular ring.

11
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:58,338
I kind of describe it as a kiss mark or a lipstick mark.

12
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:13,004
is there's a darker mare on the inboard side of the annular ring at that 7-8 o'clock position and a lighter mare on the outboard side of the annular ring on the edge there.

13
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:21,348
Those are where the lips would be and I'm noticing that the annular ring is on the

14
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:29,610
edge of the Orientale Basin where it doesn't look like the outer ring is very prominent or high.

15
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:45,295
It looks kind of flat maybe because it's lower in elevation and on the opposite side at the two or three o'clock you can see Orientale's more prominent features, rugged terrain, but more on the southeast side it looks flat

16
00:01:46,733 --> 00:02:00,936
And as I notice on the most outward piece of this ring for the bottom lip, I'll call it, on the kiss, it actually starts to, as you move outward, narrow into a triangle.

17
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:12,058
And then it looks like there's a small point that's somewhat separate of this bottom lip, almost like a bottom lip ring, I would say.

18
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,398
So that's an interesting feature.

19
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:22,303
where I never noticed that until looking at it in detail here, the extra dark patch that's outboard of the kiss itself.

20
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:36,689
And then in between the kiss and the dark mare of orientale, there's just a very light, very small crater or patch of albedo.

21
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:41,751
So I'm not sure if that's a crater that would be above the upper lip on the left side.

22
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,712
And then to the left of that, there's a little

23
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,759
white plain field as well.

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,886
And I think that's mostly it for this annular ring, but very interesting feature.
