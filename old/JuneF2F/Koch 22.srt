Christina Cook observing site 22, the Mare and Swirls.

2
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:11,218
This is a lot more evident than earlier when it was more in the Terminator.

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:23,843
We can see some of the swirling and the colors are a little bit more apparent as well as the terrain on the western side of the Mare.

4
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:28,864
There is quite a bit of uplift all around the crater, well-defined.

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:58,910
those tiles that tiling feature that I was talking about my first observation is just as apparent but now I can see that it's kind of primarily only on the eastern half of the crater as I can see right now the swirls are also not very apparent if you look very closely you can see some color deviations but not it's not super obvious

6
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:10,760
And it's not clear to me if they follow the same lines as that inner tiling that I talked about.

7
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:14,413
That wraps up this observation.
