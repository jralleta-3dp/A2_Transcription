Christina Cook recording the full moon albedo and full moon observations site 23.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:15,336
So in this view of the moon it is almost exactly a half moon with the eastern half lit.

3
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:17,597
The prominent features are ohm

4
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:33,750
crater and I would say two other high albedo areas south of Oum, one of which is close to equatorial and the other which is a few degrees latitude south of equatorial and more diffuse.

5
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:46,617
Overall the darker regions of the moon are in the north and south with several more darker mare patches that are of

6
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:53,055
diameter... I wish I had a diameter here.

7
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,176
Let's see if I can get one.

8
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:07,705
Maybe 50 to 100 kilometers in the southern region at about the 60-ish latitude area.

9
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:17,372
Kind of like, almost looking like little, like scarrings, darker mare scarrings down there, whereas the northern hemisphere doesn't really have those marks in that same way.

10
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:30,367
The higher albedo regions are all very centered in the east along kind of that eastern horizon and limb.

11
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:37,014
Those are in addition to the three prominent high albedo spots that I talked about earlier.

12
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,238
So in general it goes from a low albedo at the terminator which

13
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:47,260
to higher albedo on the east, and that isn't just because of the shattering of the Terminator.

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,542
Even when we're out of those high shadows of the Terminator, you see some of that same pattern.

15
00:01:53,562 --> 00:02:05,408
The southern hemisphere, you can really make out the overall darkness of the South Pole-Aitken Basin.

16
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:14,055
There really aren't any high albedo areas in that southern area at all.
