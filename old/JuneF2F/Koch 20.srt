Okay, this is Christina Cook, audio recording of observations from Site 20 Dewar Crater Region.

2
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:19,725
This region is in the Terminator, so it is fairly darkened and a little bit difficult to discern.

3
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,966
Might get a little closer.

4
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,848
But in general, the crater region

5
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:42,120
kind of right in the center of the Terminator is where I think that we are looking for this Dewar Crater region.

6
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:57,387
So in this dark, small region,

7
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:07,235
colors that you can see with the naked eye are a pretty similar color.

8
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:16,884
They are pretty gray, not a strong hue of orange or tan or green or pink.

9
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:22,490
If I had to pick a hue I would pick a little bit on the

10
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:36,867
green to tan side and I would say that the hues don't really change but there is a slight albedo change where the southern area is a little bit of a lighter higher albedo.

11
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:52,078
I don't see any real evidence of swirls but I do see some differing color areas and differing albedo.

12
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,512
but nothing overly remarkable in this region.

13
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:16,143
Recognizing that it has some volcanic history, I can see that it is almost like a lighter version of a small mare, but not as distinctive as some of our other mare regions.

14
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:32,300
The relationship of it to other features, I do think there's at least one newer crater on it that's very well defined.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,865
And it might be the darkest actual region when we're not thinking about, you know, not counting the shadows in this area.

16
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:52,110
And it is also pretty smooth other than the one distinctive crater that's kind of on top of it.

17
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,516
And that'll wrap up my recording.
