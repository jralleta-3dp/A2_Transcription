Christina Cook, annotating for site 4, Glushko Crater.

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:08,489
This is a very light area.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:17,775
It is near the eastern limb and it is near a mare but distinct from it.

4
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:21,056
It has what appear to be rays.

5
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:41,226
But most distinctively, especially different from some of the other high albedo, I'm going to do that in real life, high albedo spots on the moon, it has an area around it that is also high albedo that's not distinctive line rays.

6
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:44,569
And that area is almost like another concentric circle around it.

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,392
The diameter of that second concentric circle around it is

8
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:58,571
about two to three times the diameter of Glushko Crater, the white spot in the middle.

9
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:03,112
And it's also not 100% uniform.

10
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:20,076
There's an area at about the 12 o'clock position from the crater, 12 to 1130, that is a darker area, not quite as dark as the mare fields, but about mid-grade between a very high albedo and the darker mare.

11
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:49,407
So in other words, overall, this crater is a very high albedo center, a two to three diameter times that diameter of a light gray with one speckle of a darker gray on it, and then some rays out from there that are the same color as the wider of the light grays.

12
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:53,164
None of those grays have any hue to them.

13
00:01:54,744 --> 00:02:04,087
They are all kind of the same hue, which is a very gray gray, no green, tan or pink.

14
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:11,790
And I'm not able to make out any terracing features or any terrain features.

15
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,560
From this view, it does seem pretty flat.

16
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:25,269
The one exception to that, if I squint, I can kind of see almost like a target pattern within the very inner high albedo area.

17
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,294
That's hard to say if that's really there.

18
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:35,158
Okay, that's five minutes on that one, so I think that's about it.
