1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:05,117
All right, next up for me is a Terminator target.

2
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:08,961
I'm still in the port forward window.

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:10,923
I'm going to take a mosaic here.

4
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:19,933
Some other crew members got called off on another task, so I'm going to try to go both take the pictures and description at the same time here, see how that goes.

5
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:25,220
Capturing a mosaic now along the terminator for this target.

6
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:34,972
So again, I'm using both my eyes and camera looking up and down just over the viewfinder as I'm making these observations and taking the photos.

7
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:48,319
This is a oblique view trying to capture the top, which I think our orientation right now is with the moon kind of upright or north from our current attitude.

8
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,622
And one of the things that's really sticking out to me that I'll describe and hopefully capture it in this mosaic is the larger impact basin.

9
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,684
I'm not sure of the name of that one yet, but

10
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:07,333
It's a larger impact basin with a medium-sized crater kind of at it's seven or eight o'clock.

11
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:15,462
It's near the northern pool at least and it's the terminators right on it right now which is really making it pop.

12
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,286
So hopefully capturing good photos of that.

13
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,614
No noticeable hues or colors.

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:35,865
It's mostly really dark on the west side or the left of my left right now of the terminator not seeing anything beyond that crater that I described at a larger impact basin.

15
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:41,708
and then it's just shades of gray as we go eastward.

16
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:46,471
What's really popping is the smaller craters as well.

17
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:53,155
What I'm seeing is the shadows almost fill the bottom of the medium-sized craters, but the small craters

18
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:57,976
are really popping more than what we've seen a little bit earlier.

19
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:04,558
And it really makes for a unique texture across the illuminated portion.

20
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:10,839
Hopefully got that mosaic for you and gonna bounce on the next target.

21
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:14,680
I think I'm a little bit behind my timeline and call this mosaic good.
