### Transcript 001

1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:05,221
All right, next up is Mare Ingenii.

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:10,345
I'm going to the forward window with the camera in hand.

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:16,310
It's just me up here trying to make a lot of observations, zooming in with my camera here.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,433
So I'm just going to do some talk out loud for you.

5
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:24,877
All right, so Ingenii, let me first orient myself.

6
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,620
I've got no oblique view from the lunar

7
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,524
targeting plan.

8
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:35,389
Let's see, north there, so go south.

9
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,714
Really just looking along the terminator.

10
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:43,561
That's what I expect my main indicator will be.

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,584
This is a pretty cool looking

12
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,673
cool looking mare.

13
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:51,033
Okay, so I see, okay, I've found SBA.

14
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:53,574
I'm looking just along the terminator.

15
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:58,136
It's like from this image that my plan.

16
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:04,098
Looking for mare info, got some irregular shapes spilling out.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,020
Yeah, okay, I'm not really seeing it yet.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,941
I'm just continue looking down.

19
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,083
Okay, I'm seeing a crater that has these kind of five

20
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,954
like, craters aligned within it.

21
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,579
You know, in this kind of elongated snowman-looking crater.

22
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,200
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,081
Okay, now I'm seeing it.

24
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:38,068
It kind of looks, this Injunai kind of looks like a, almost like an octopus shape, with the kind of legs of the octopus facing away from the Terminator.

25
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,990
All right, okay, I'm seeing it now.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,813
I think I was trying to look a little too early because it was still in shadow.

27
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,895
So, yeah, I see it now.

28
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:56,545
And it's a really clear circular shape where the boundary facing away from the Terminator is at the broken part of this kind of circle.

29
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:04,629
So it's not a complete circle because when I zoom in with my camera, there's almost this like elongated island in the broken boundary.

30
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,050
And that island is kind of like maybe less than a quarter.

31
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,408
of this overall shape.

32
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,816
And again, that kind of broken part of that circle is facing away from the Terminator.

33
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,078
That's really cool.

34
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:28,209
But yeah, overall Engine Eye also has like a raised, like bigger ridge that's like around and like encircling the crater.

35
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,350
It's at least an interrelating part of it.

36
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:39,975
Kind of looks like a C-shape from where I'm at now, where the opening of the C is kind of disappearing into the darkness of the Terminator.

37
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,517
So maybe I'll just keep an eye on that for the next time I come around here.

38
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:48,916
But yeah, the interior doesn't look solid.

39
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:55,163
It actually kind of has some albedo variations where there is lighter and darker, but I mean, I'm not really seeing a pattern in there.

40
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,486
So it doesn't really look smooth either.

41
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:04,192
That basin kind of looks undulating or hummocky, maybe even seeing a wrinkle in there.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,234
Yeah, and I'm also seeing like maybe, if I zoom in, I think I do see like little specks and little craters in here.

43
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:25,083
But yeah, that wrinkle is parallel and like kind of in the same strike as that island of that boundary that I described, that kind of broken outer boundary of Ingenii.

44
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,285
So that's cool.

45
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,848
I can't see too much more, so I'll end it there and then I'll come back to this in a little bit.

### Transcript 002

1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:04,716
Okay, next up on the LTP, Orientale.

2
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:11,071
Alright, looks like they're specifically asking us to focus on the angular range, but I need to look at the LGR to refresh my memory.

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:15,205
Okay, yeah, beautiful impact basin right here.

4
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,727
Let me try to make sure I'm looking at the right thing here, though.

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:21,852
Okay, yeah, pretty distinctive feature, and I know it's one of our geography anchor points.

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,795
Jacob, don't worry, I did my geography homework.

7
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,376
All right, Angela's next to me.

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:30,681
I know she's working on getting it in her camera view, but for now I'll say, whew, this is a beauty.

9
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,401
Angela, you see this?

10
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:33,784
Uh, yeah, just give me, give me a second.

11
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:35,245
I'm just trying to get to the right, uh,

12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:36,687
Oh, no.

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:37,608
All right.

14
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:37,908
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:38,790
Oh, that's that.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,071
Oh, wow.

17
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:40,652
I know.

18
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,394
Beautiful multi-ring base in here.

19
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:48,020
It's off to the left of Oceanus Procellarum, maybe at a distance of like one Orientale diameter.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,182
It's roughly circular.

21
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,264
Two primary sets of rings.

22
00:00:52,045 --> 00:01:07,202
which rim kind of a dark mare patch i think in the middle the mare patch is roughly circular maybe slightly elongate uh in the north south axis the dark patch is quite dark especially at its southern end but the northern end has a much brighter albedo

23
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,484
Yeah, I got some good, got some good pictures over here.

24
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,566
Alright, did you, cause like, I can't quite make out the detail with my naked eye.

25
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,767
Can you look at the northern end of the Mare patch?

26
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:23,934
I'd be interested to hear your take, but it looks like maybe a much brighter, and I think maybe they said that that means younger crater came in here and it's sending its ejecta down into the Mare patch?

27
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,036
Yeah, let me just try and get this focus.

28
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,518
It's kind of hard to, to kind of stay in.

29
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:32,122
in with what I'm trying to target when I'm moving around a little bit.

30
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,666
So just give me a second while I'm rolling on here.

31
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:35,067
All right.

32
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,509
Just want to make sure I'm not crazy.

33
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,831
Here, let me help you with that.

34
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:38,131
Hold on.

35
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:39,052
Yeah, here.

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,215
Do you want to use the camera to just get it better?

37
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,097
No, no, no.

38
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:42,497
You got it.

39
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:42,818
You got it.

40
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,300
I'll just anger you here for a second.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,400
OK.

42
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:48,574
All right, let's see.

43
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:51,375
I see a few other younger craters on top of the mare patch.

44
00:01:51,615 --> 00:02:03,098
My personal favorite, wow, now that I'm looking at this, it's a crater just to the east of like the main big mare patch that maybe itself, the crater looks like it has its own tiny little patch of dark material within it.

45
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:04,019
Interesting.

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,719
I might need to hear the science team's interpretation of that one.

47
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,260
Angela, can you get a picture of my favorite crater over here?

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,941
Yeah, point it up, right there.

49
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,522
It's this one, right off to the right side of that mare patch.

50
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:16,482
Look at it, it's got a little baby mare patch in it.

51
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:17,383
Oh, I see it!

52
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,003
It's so cute!

53
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,043
Look at the picture!

54
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:20,244
Oh, that's awesome.

55
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:22,124
Alright, I think we got it, science.

56
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:26,205
Okay, so, sorry, I know I'm getting really distracted by these smaller craters.

57
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,246
You know how I love craters.

58
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,386
Back to Orientale proper here.

59
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:36,629
Looks like its mare patch has rounded edges in most places, whereas the two rings have sort of like a scalloped look.

60
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,693
The inner of the two rings looks like it's got some topography to it.

61
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,675
It's not fully continuous all the way around.

62
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:52,445
Not sure if it's just an illumination effect, but the that southern end of the ring looks like it has more of like a topography pop to it, especially down at like the five to six o'clock position.

63
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:57,110
I say that because there's like a higher albedo section of that inner ring that just pops.

64
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:17,387
over up on the northeast side of the inner ring maybe between like i don't know midnight and three o'clock there's a lot going on wow geez throughout that whole section there's a patch of the dark low albedo mare-like material it starts just inside the inner ring it's not too big all right wow and look distracted i know i'm supposed to be thinking about the annular ring do you remember what they mean by annular ring

65
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:19,649
Uh, yeah, it's in your lunar target.

66
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:20,530
It's in your lunar dot!

67
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,114
All right, fine, yeah, check the tape.

68
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:26,759
All right, I can't quite tell here, but maybe they mean this dark circle down here to the south.

69
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,741
Oh yeah, that's ringing a bell from training.

70
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,984
Now that I'm looking at this... Angela, what is this?

71
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,308
It's a circular feature, but it's definitely not a crater.

72
00:03:33,828 --> 00:04:02,471
or I don't really see any topography it looks kind of like just like a dark ring of material like lower albedo that looks kind of like I don't know superficial on top of everything else I even see a place at like three o'clock on the ring where it's sitting on top of the inner Orientale ring I I remember my superposition science team don't worry it's younger than that ring the ring is more concentrated and darker for like the whole top half whereas like the southern half is kind of diffuse and I think slightly higher in albedo is what I'm seeing but Angela I'd like to hear if you you see the same

73
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:05,854
Yeah, I think it's a little bit higher in albedo.

74
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:06,895
That's what I'd agree.

75
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,496
But don't worry, I'm going to get pictures.

76
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:09,717
Because really, I don't know.

77
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,778
I trust my eyes right now.

78
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,841
I've been staring at this bright moon for a little bit too long.

79
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,483
It can never be too long.

80
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:17,284
All right.

81
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:17,925
Well, OK.

82
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:18,766
I've been talking for a while.

83
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,646
I have no idea how long.

84
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,168
I hope this didn't get us off timeline.

85
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,849
All right, last big picture comment.

86
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,730
I know you want us to talk about facial relationships.

87
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,653
I do see a really bright, really small crater off to the east side of Orientale.

88
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:35,875
It's got some beautiful bright rays coming out that do cross Orientale, and that's a beauty.

89
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,756
I wish I could remember what it's called.

90
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,317
And that's Orientale, folks.

91
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:40,177
What a ride.

92
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:41,358
Woo!

### Transcript 003

1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:05,117
All right, next up for me is a Terminator target.

2
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:08,961
I'm still in the port forward window.

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:10,923
I'm going to take a mosaic here.

4
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:19,933
Some other crew members got called off on another task, so I'm going to try to go both take the pictures and description at the same time here, see how that goes.

5
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:25,220
Capturing a mosaic now along the terminator for this target.

6
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:34,972
So again, I'm using both my eyes and camera looking up and down just over the viewfinder as I'm making these observations and taking the photos.

7
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:48,319
This is a oblique view trying to capture the top, which I think our orientation right now is with the moon kind of upright or north from our current attitude.

8
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,622
And one of the things that's really sticking out to me that I'll describe and hopefully capture it in this mosaic is the larger impact basin.

9
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,684
I'm not sure of the name of that one yet, but

10
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:07,333
It's a larger impact basin with a medium-sized crater kind of at it's seven or eight o'clock.

11
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:15,462
It's near the northern pool at least and it's the terminators right on it right now which is really making it pop.

12
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,286
So hopefully capturing good photos of that.

13
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,614
No noticeable hues or colors.

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:35,865
It's mostly really dark on the west side or the left of my left right now of the terminator not seeing anything beyond that crater that I described at a larger impact basin.

15
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:41,708
and then it's just shades of gray as we go eastward.

16
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:46,471
What's really popping is the smaller craters as well.

17
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:53,155
What I'm seeing is the shadows almost fill the bottom of the medium-sized craters, but the small craters

18
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:57,976
are really popping more than what we've seen a little bit earlier.

19
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:04,558
And it really makes for a unique texture across the illuminated portion.

20
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:10,839
Hopefully got that mosaic for you and gonna bounce on the next target.

21
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:14,680
I think I'm a little bit behind my timeline and call this mosaic good.

00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:06,953
Okay, next up is Leibnitz Target.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,014
Kelsey's got the camera.

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:14,297
I'm now in the port starboard window making observations, trying to get oriented.

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,279
The target name is Leibnitz Crater.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,381
Trying to get oriented.

6
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:28,326
It's a little bit skewed to us now, so doing some magic here with the tablet to get oriented.

7
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:35,427
oblique to us and got a pretty good view at it.

8
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:40,071
And I think the target is to try to get a good zoom on this one, Kelsey.

9
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,613
It's a really circular crater.

10
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:50,181
If I'm looking at the right one with Leibnitz, it's got a rubbly texture that surrounds the interior of the crater.

11
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,762
It's got really two unique craters inside of it.

12
00:00:54,223 --> 00:01:10,970
One is, I can see the depression given this illumination, the other one looks like it's infilled a little bit, looks like two eyes if I turn my head the right way, and then the the face of the crater or the nose of the crater would, there is a some distinctive color change

13
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:18,953
I think this may be something that I was cuing my eyes into earlier with these lunar swirls and a little bit of color change.

14
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,515
It's definitely brighter in that area.

15
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,717
Again, struggling with the orientation, but I believe

16
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:35,163
I believe Oppenheimer and Apollo Basin were just to the north of this now or just upwards of this.

17
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:38,685
I don't know if I've got my orientation right, but I could be a little screwed up on this one.

18
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:43,228
Hopefully the camera will capture its orientation with the surrounding craters.

19
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:58,715
Shadows are coming from the bottom up now and making the six o'clock of our view right now very distinctive, that rubbly texture I described at the more southern or the six o'clock position of the crater.

20
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:12,668
and the 12 o'clock position of the crater from our orientation definitely has a disturbed rim as a medium-sized crater has definitely disturbed that rim and made some unique features in there.

21
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:23,217
Slopes look pretty crazy in that rubbly area and the textures are just pretty flat across the middle of that crater, just

22
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:30,658
wanted to definitely highlight and hopefully the camera captures that unique colorization that we're seeing in some of that possible lunar swirls.

23
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,520
Um, it's a tonal difference, definitely makes it stand out.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Um, and the, the swirl part is a little bit lighter toned.

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:50,183
Uh, I would say medium gray leading up to that a little bit brighter white to tan, um, lunar swirl area in the center of the crater as described.

26
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:50,923
Okay.

27
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:51,843
Onto the next target.

### Transcript 005

1
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:07,775
Alright, I'm getting set up in the forward port window and Kelsey's got the camera in the starboard window.

2
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,544
Next up on our target list looks to be the Apollo Basin.

3
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:24,384
Got a good close view of that in our current orientation, mostly by eyes, but I did take a quick look at it through the camera at the highest zoom.

4
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:29,868
Our orientation is slightly oblique, but got a pretty good view of it now.

5
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,891
Just want to say a few things about the size.

6
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:42,397
It's really filling the field of view of the camera at full zoom when I took that quick peek, and hopefully Kelsey's capturing that now.

7
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:58,624
It's hard to make out the boundaries in this illumination I definitely can make out the boundary where the contact is to that larger crater from Apollo To its left side.

8
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:04,307
Let me look real quick and see what crater that is Hang on one second.

9
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:05,947
Oh, it's Oppenheimer.

10
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,088
So yeah, just to

11
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:20,687
what I'll say the left of Apollo is Oppenheimer in our current orientation and so it can definitely make out some very distinctive structure there between the two.

12
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:28,647
What I did want to point out here is the pronounced rust color that I'm picking up on the mare that's nearest to Oppenheimer.

13
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:40,975
So the mare I'm talking about is, there's like a mare in the center of Apollo Basin, and then there's a smaller little patch closer to that Oppenheimer crater.

14
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:46,238
And I'm picking up a really distinctive rust color, especially in this illumination condition.

15
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,221
The mare in the center of

16
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,418
of Apollo Basin doesn't look to have that rust color.

17
00:01:55,658 --> 00:02:00,062
It looks darker to me, a little bit on the, you know, blacker side.

18
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:14,313
And then the mare to the south, so if Oppenheimer is at nine o'clock, so at six o'clock of Apollo Basin, the mare to the south may also have that slight rust color that I'm picking up.

19
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,254
But definitely the

20
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:28,285
The mare at the nine o'clock closest to Oppenheimer's got this really interesting rust color that I haven't seen that, certainly not in our other observations.

21
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,208
Overall, just checking my cue card here.

22
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,311
Oh, the shadows, yeah, just not too much shadows.

23
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:42,818
As I said, this illumination condition's not picking out a lot of shadows, but I do really see some distinctive structure between Apollo

24
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:44,518
Oppenheimer.

25
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:55,883
That's kind of what's sticking out to me most as far as the structure and also that range just to the left side or the nine o'clock of the center of Apollo Basin.

26
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:06,907
There's a mountain range, I'll call it, that runs kind of north-south or from between 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock just to the left of that central mare.

27
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:12,429
That's also really sticking out to me and hopefully Kelsey's capturing that in some of the photos.

28
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,432
Yeah, that's all I want to say on Apollo.

29
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:19,813
I'm going to go check on the target list for the next one.

30
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:20,377
Thanks.

### Transcript 006

1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,804
Okay, what do we got here?

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:03,385
What's next?

3
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:05,808
What's next Buys-Ballot?

4
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,930
Oh I'm not sure.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,711
I remember this too.

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:12,496
Well, you're gonna need to give me some direction Yeah, I'm gonna need to give myself some direction.

7
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,718
All right, let's pull up the lunar geography review.

8
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:17,241
I know we're on the far side Clicking in there

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,472
Oh gosh, it's not even on this medium label.

10
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:21,132
It's right.

11
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:21,552
Yeah.

12
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:21,932
Okay.

13
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:23,913
Oh, wow.

14
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:24,313
Okay.

15
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,834
That's a small sucker.

16
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:26,934
Okay.

17
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:30,136
It should be like halfway between Jackson and Moscoviense.

18
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,136
So let's see here.

19
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:34,337
Let me go back to the targeting plan.

20
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:35,978
Let me see what we got.

21
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:36,458
Okay.

22
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,499
This is tough.

23
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:40,640
What am I even looking at here?

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,240
Where?

25
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,201
I got my camera ready.

26
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:47,025
Should Moscoviense be off to the west, Angela?

27
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:47,986
I don't know.

28
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,108
I can't see Moscoviense anymore.

29
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,970
Oh, is there a possibility?

30
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,751
Is this upside down?

31
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,754
All right, let me flip this upside down here.

32
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:56,315
What do we got?

33
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:57,897
Okay.

34
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:02,919
So the image in the targeting plan was upside down, but now I think I got it.

35
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,082
So I think I see Jackson Crater, that really popped.

36
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:13,226
So it looks like Buys-Ballot, yep, they're telling me it should be pretty, pretty close to... How pretty is pretty?

37
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,727
That's a good question.

38
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,189
Like the size of Jackson?

39
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,490
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,112
It's maybe like, it's about the size of Jackson and it's maybe about like...

41
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:40,734
i don't even know eight to ten jackson diameters which direction to the i think if i'm looking at this right it's to the west to the west so yeah okay yeah all right so i think i got it here that took a while sorry about that shape stuff because i'm looking at a lot of graders that might be around that size

42
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,518
Yeah, the shape, wow, look at this.

43
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:48,922
This is, this almost looks like, I don't know, like an arrowhead or something.

44
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,804
Like it's, it's... Oh, I got it.

45
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,544
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,725
I'll take some pictures now.

47
00:01:52,966 --> 00:02:01,213
Yeah, it's like an arrowhead feature and there's actually like a higher topographic ridge that runs through the middle of Buys-Ballot.

48
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:01,973
So let me see here.

49
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:24,758
yeah and it's it's kind of sitting on or under i can't quite tell from here no it's got to be sitting on a crater that's just sort of at the fat arrowhead end yeah and it's that that one it's sitting on looks like it's got more muted topography i'm thinking and the tip of the arrow is kind of pointing at like uh oh i guess it's telling me on the ltp it's the Lacus Luxuriae Region

50
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:25,398
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:26,839
It looks like kind of like a spillout.

52
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:27,459
Yeah.

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,540
It's a dark kind of like grayish blue looking.

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,021
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:31,421
Okay.

56
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,981
I'll take some pictures of that.

57
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:43,666
Slightly the area outside of Buys-Ballot is kind of like darker and albedo and then Boy's Ballad does look kind of crisp next to the surrounding features I'm thinking.

58
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:48,328
Does it look like it's spilling out because it kind of looks like it's coming from maybe that arrow point to me?

59
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:49,008
Maybe.

60
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,309
It's kind of hard to tell and I guess

61
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:56,370
Yeah, I mean, maybe one edge of Buys-Ballot looks more muted in topography than the other edge.

62
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,711
Do you see what I'm saying here?

63
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,171
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,113
I mean, it might be the shadows, but yeah, I see what you mean by that.

65
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,335
Alright, I'll be honest.

66
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:04,615
I'm not too sure what's going on here.

67
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:09,018
I know that there can be some weird-looking craters, but this one is an oddball.

68
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,682
I think all we can really do here, Angela, is get some pictures of it and hope that the science team back on Earth can figure this out for us.

69
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:24,535
Yep, I'll make sure that my focus of my camera is all over that area so you can maybe do some cool stuff with the photos, but I got the pictures.

70
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,058
Alright, moving on.

### Transcript 007

1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:21,183
all righty i heard that we're gonna start to see the moon so buckle up i got my cam ready oh wow oh i'm starting to see this liver this liver of the it looks like a wow what do you got yeah it's earth peeking from behind the moon and it is

2
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,235
Beautiful!

3
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:23,955

This is what we've been waiting for!

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,999
And look out the window!

9
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:35,201
It's, it's everything right... there.

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,382
Wow.

11
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:38,463
A beauty!

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,684
That's, that's something special.

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,245
That's, that's pretty breathtaking.

14
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,826
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take a moment.

15
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:47,627
Yeah, wow.

16
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,648
Take a look at that.

17
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:50,799
Alright, I'm doing it.

18
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm blocking it out with my thumb.

19
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,026
It's an honor, guys.

20
00:00:57,106 --> 00:01:04,855
There's really no one I'd rather be here right now in this moment than with you guys.

21
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:05,976
Back at ya.

22
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:09,394
Trevor, stop what you're doing over there.

23
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:10,095
Stop being productive.

24
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,537
Come on over and take a look at this.

25
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:13,760
All right, all right.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,282
Okay, I'll start to describe.

27
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:23,953
Yeah, I'm seeing the, oh, it's just, it's hard to do the science, but I'm looking at something so special.

28
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,635
Yeah, I'm seeing the blues.

29
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:28,399
Dark and light blues.

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,561
The white's really standing out.

31
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,524
Hi, Antarctica!

32
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,607
Earth's South Pole looks pretty great from over here.

33
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,851
Oh, I can see you guys, Houston.

34
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,955
See those swirls of clouds.

35
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,236
South America.

36
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,205
Oh, don't worry, Earth.

37
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,867
I'm getting pictures of all your good angles.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,068
You're looking great from here, Houston.

39
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:55,488
Oh, all right.

40
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:58,069
And now I take a full Earth.

41
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,489
So mark this time.

42
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:00,110
That's when the...

43
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,707
I can see it all.

44
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:07,429
There's no more shadow of the moon on the Earth.

45
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,671
So that's pretty crazy.

46
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,112
Space has never looked so black from over here.

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:20,057
So yes, Earth is coming right above or north of the equator or the equatorial line.

48
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:23,559
So like if north is 12 o'clock, we're looking at like 930.

49
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,321
Man, the Earth looks so smooth.

50
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,895
It looks peaceful from here, doesn't it?

51
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,015
It really does.

52
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:36,657
And the far side of the moon looks pretty rough compared to just how smooth and beautiful the Earth is.

53
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm feeling like the luckiest person, not on Earth, luckiest person around the moon right now.

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,821
Yeah, I can see it all, Houston.

55
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,221
I'm starting to feel a little homesick.

56
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,983
But yeah, I'm looking through my camera lens.

57
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,249
See a little bit more detail for you guys.

58
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,393
I can see the greens and the browns.

59
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,398
See Amazon rainforests.

60
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,780
Maybe those are the Andes.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,841
Maybe those are the Andes.

62
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,315
Absolutely gorgeous.

63
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,337
Angela's got some good pictures here.

64
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:09,899
Hey, mark this up.

65
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,902
This is definitely the first one that we're going to have to send down back to Earth.

66
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:16,386
People are going to want to see these pictures as soon as we can.

67
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,248
So prep yourself, Houston.

68
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:21,191
You've got some beautiful shots coming down.

69
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,873
I can't wait to tell you all about it.

70
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,395
Oh my god.

71
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,135
I could cry.

### Transcript 008

1
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:03,913
All right, Houston, I'm coming back to Ingenii.

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:11,757
So I did a pass on Ingenii in a more oblique view, and now I'm coming back at a more nadir view, now that some time has passed.

3
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:15,198
And it's super easy to find now, because I know exactly what I'm looking for.

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:19,760
So let's give you some descriptions here.

5
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:28,545
So first thing that pops up, this outer rim that I talked about, that looks like a bigger raised topographic high, that's

6
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:41,933
that was that sea but I didn't know if that sea connected and it does look like it's completely, I'd say roughly encircling Ingenii and then a crater that's around the same size as Ingenii and then a few other smaller craters in that.

7
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:45,295
So it's definitely within that boundary.

8
00:00:46,315 --> 00:01:11,433
um let's see looking a little bit closer with my camera um yeah these light and dark toned albedo um kind of basin color variations it's definitely uh definitely seeing what you were describing as the lunar swirls here um i will say there's no real pattern that's coming out to me um but i am seeing some great uh variations at this angle that weren't weren't as clear in the oblique view so

9
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:20,096
I'll make sure to get you guys some pictures and you can you can tell me what you what you see And yeah these there's some craters that are popping out as well.

10
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:29,800
I wasn't a little sure before but now I'm there's like one crater That's like smack dab in the center of Ingenii and I could see that really really clearly Oh, there's another one.

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,761
That's like pretty distinct to that's

12
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,282
I called Ingenii like the octopus.

13
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:48,869
It's like in the northern leg of that octopus, where that elongated island is separating out the kind of northern legs and the southern legs, if you're picking up what I'm saying.

14
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:59,035
And there's a, in between, you know, kind of following along that rough boundary circular of Ingenii, I'm seeing another pretty bright crater.

15
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:01,136
And honestly, actually, it looks like there's some

16
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:08,138
light toned albedo kind of color that's associated with that as well.

17
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:16,660
And it's really associated with the, I guess it's the eastern kind of fan of that crater.

18
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,441
So there's a little bit of association with that crater there.

19
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,421
So I'll make sure to get some good pics of that.

20
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:27,482
Yeah, I noted a kind of wrinkle that I saw and I'm seeing that too.

21
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:28,623
There's actually another one.

22
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:49,579
that i'm seeing as well that's kind of close to the terminator but like more on the southern end of of engine eye but around the same strike um as that more prominent one um that's on the western side so that's pretty uh that's a little bit more noticeable now um there's also seems to maybe be like some uh

23
00:02:50,731 --> 00:03:05,126
Some like lineations maybe, some alignments of maybe craters or like maybe it's a little bit hard to say, but maybe they're like these lighter tone kind of lines and those lines are going maybe like, hold on, let me think about what direction these are going.

24
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,611
Kind of west striking kind of roughly.

25
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:21,537
Man, kind of hard to say here, but it's almost, it's roughly perpendicular or like 45 degrees in perpendicular from that wrinkle ridge that I was, that wrinkle I was talking about.

26
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:25,879
And that looks like it's crossing like the entirety of Ingenii.

27
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,923
So, and I, other than that though, there's not like a ton of pattern that I'm seeing in the mare, but super cool views.

28
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:38,365
And don't worry, science, I'm going to get you all kinds of pictures.

### Transcript 009

1
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,655
Alright, okay, I gotta take a moment to collect myself here.

2
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:08,237
Next target.

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,118
What do we have?

4
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:12,561
Okay, looking for a description of Terminator morphology, I think?

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,442
Let me get oriented.

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,023
Whoa!

7
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,045
Whoa!

8
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:16,726
Angela, you guys!

9
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:17,707
You're not gonna believe this!

10
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:18,047
What?

11
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,490
I really think I just saw a flash here!

12
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,110
No, you didn't!

13
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,594
No, it was a bright white flash, really tiny, but it was there.

14
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:25,215
Did you see it, Trevor?

15
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:26,676
Yeah, come on over here.

16
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,017
Well, I guess you missed it now, huh?

17
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,158
I wonder if any of the saw cameras caught that.

18
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:36,763
It was just like a bright white light over there in the unilluminated portion of the moon, really fleeting, but that was inspiring.

19
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:37,503
Where was it?

20
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:43,167
Well, so here I am in the port forward window, and I think it was kind of like off in the upper right quadrant of my view here.

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,070
Wow, that was incredible.

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,751
I hope you can pull this out of other vehicle data.

23
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:49,652
I mean, wow.

24
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,753
We got to get a seismometer on the moon ASAP.

25
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:56,275
I'll be honest, I was kind of skeptical we'd see one of these, but we sure got lucky.

26
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,055
What an experience.

27
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:02,478
I think I remember this was really high priority for the lunar science team, so I'm really glad we got this data point for them.

28
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,059
All right, mark the time that you've seen it.

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,379
Yeah.
