1
23:40:02,068 --> 23:40:07,270
All right, this is Andre, and I'm doing my target six.

2
23:40:07,570 --> 23:40:09,630
This is the Orientale annular ring.

3
23:40:10,751 --> 23:40:17,012
As I'm looking at Orientale, I'm at the, oh, thank you.

4
23:40:29,436 --> 23:40:29,536
Cool.

5
23:40:30,145 --> 23:40:34,427
All right, so for Orientale, I have it identified.

6
23:40:34,787 --> 23:40:38,229
It's got the outer ring and the inner ring.

7
23:40:38,409 --> 23:40:40,310
There is a dark mare in the middle.

8
23:40:40,830 --> 23:40:42,811
It's a dark gray overall.

9
23:40:42,831 --> 23:40:46,732
There's some shades of lighter gray as well.

10
23:40:47,133 --> 23:40:54,016
And then on the 7 and 8 o'clock position of Orientale, I see the annular ring.

11
23:40:54,536 --> 23:40:58,338
I kind of describe it as a kiss mark or a lipstick mark.

12
23:40:59,998 --> 23:41:13,004
is there's a darker mare on the inboard side of the annular ring at that 7-8 o'clock position and a lighter mare on the outboard side of the annular ring on the edge there.

13
23:41:13,024 --> 23:41:21,348
Those are where the lips would be and I'm noticing that the annular ring is on the

14
23:41:21,988 --> 23:41:29,610
edge of the Orientale Basin where it doesn't look like the outer ring is very prominent or high.

15
23:41:29,670 --> 23:41:45,295
It looks kind of flat maybe because it's lower in elevation and on the opposite side at the two or three o'clock you can see Orientale's more prominent features, rugged terrain, but more on the southeast side it looks flat

16
23:41:46,733 --> 23:42:00,936
And as I notice on the most outward piece of this ring for the bottom lip, I'll call it, on the kiss, it actually starts to, as you move outward, narrow into a triangle.

17
23:42:01,456 --> 23:42:12,058
And then it looks like there's a small point that's somewhat separate of this bottom lip, almost like a bottom lip ring, I would say.

18
23:42:12,858 --> 23:42:14,398
So that's an interesting feature.

19
23:42:15,020 --> 23:42:22,303
where I never noticed that until looking at it in detail here, the extra dark patch that's outboard of the kiss itself.

20
23:42:23,523 --> 23:42:36,689
And then in between the kiss and the dark mare of orientale, there's just a very light, very small crater or patch of albedo.

21
23:42:36,829 --> 23:42:41,751
So I'm not sure if that's a crater that would be above the upper lip on the left side.

22
23:42:42,931 --> 23:42:44,712
And then to the left of that, there's a little

23
23:42:45,297 --> 23:42:46,759
white plain field as well.

24
23:42:48,120 --> 23:42:53,886
And I think that's mostly it for this annular ring, but very interesting feature.

### Transcript 002

1
23:45:01,222 --> 23:45:05,037
All right, coming up on the Dewar Crater region here.

2
23:45:06,882 --> 23:45:11,584
I think I'll be, well, someone will be getting the opportunity to look at it again later.

3
23:45:12,744 --> 23:45:20,328
But for right now, I see it's fairly close to the terminator edge.

4
23:45:20,788 --> 23:45:32,413
I know I'm looking for a sort of albedo anomaly here and looking for some sort of like darker material that kind of comes out from the bottom of Dewar.

5
23:45:34,133 --> 23:45:35,454
I think I see it.

6
23:45:35,834 --> 23:45:37,034
It's more diffuse.

7
23:45:37,514 --> 23:45:46,776
I don't really see, it's not like constrained or confined to a crater, but rather it appears to be darker material.

8
23:45:46,836 --> 23:45:56,579
I don't see a ton of like vibrant colors, but it's definitely darker material that's kind of coming out like to the, almost like the southeast of Dewar Crater.

9
23:45:59,780 --> 23:46:01,660
Let's see, size, it's probably like,

10
23:46:03,065 --> 23:46:11,272
maybe one Dewar Crater diameter, long away from, again, the southeast edge of Dewar Crater.

11
23:46:11,292 --> 23:46:19,518
And again, it's diffuse, even the sort of like the boundaries of the Albedo Anomaly itself are fairly diffuse.

12
23:46:20,719 --> 23:46:26,604
It also kind of comes up like sort of to the east and the north a bit, again, diffused.

13
23:46:26,684 --> 23:46:29,487
It almost looks like, I don't know, like someone

14
23:46:30,047 --> 23:46:38,279
sprayed flour on the lunar surface or something and it sort of came out in an irregular pattern from the middle of Dewar crater.

15
23:46:40,001 --> 23:46:41,664
Let's see what else I can tell you here.

16
23:46:46,018 --> 23:46:52,700
Texture-wise, it doesn't appear to have an underlying consistent texture that's associated with the albedo anomaly.

17
23:46:52,720 --> 23:47:01,142
I can't quite tell if there's any sort of surface texture associated with it, which makes me think there likely isn't.

18
23:47:01,202 --> 23:47:07,004
It really just does appear to be a darker patch of lunar surface.

19
23:47:07,564 --> 23:47:08,284
I hope that's helpful.

20
23:47:08,304 --> 23:47:09,585
Looking forward to round two.

### Transcript 003

1
23:50:01,702 --> 23:50:05,944
All right, moving on to Mare Inginii in Swirls, target number five.

2
23:50:06,304 --> 23:50:16,427
I've got a good view of it out the window, getting a little bit of glare coming across a portion of the moon, but it got Mare Inginii pretty clear.

3
23:50:18,768 --> 23:50:26,772
One of the things that immediately stands out to me is the in-bang relationships of some of the infill.

4
23:50:27,512 --> 23:50:31,554
I expected it to be a little bit rougher, but man, it really looks smooth.

5
23:50:33,078 --> 23:50:50,285
The boundary relationship between the embayment and the hills, especially to the three o'clock of that feature with the 12 o'clock being the moon as it's currently oriented in the window, are really stark.

6
23:50:50,926 --> 23:50:57,589
So across the three o'clock, that boundary between the embayment of the two little ears that are kind of looking

7
23:50:59,009 --> 23:51:10,060
towards that three o'clock direction and the hills, if I call it that, just adjacent to them is really stark and really prominent from this orientation.

8
23:51:11,942 --> 23:51:18,166
I'm looking pretty close at any color relations or colors that stick out to me.

9
23:51:18,186 --> 23:51:25,371
I'm not seeing anything immediate, but the albedo of those swirls is definitely standing out to me.

10
23:51:25,391 --> 23:51:37,499
I can see light tone grays, but also a medium gray that are pretty stark against the background of that infilling material.

11
23:51:37,519 --> 23:51:40,641
So I was seeing at least three tones of gray

12
23:51:41,461 --> 23:51:46,042
no distinct colors outside that gray spectrum from my eye right now.

13
23:51:47,123 --> 23:51:58,646
The illumination is perfect right now, especially to pick up those hills that I was talking about at the three o'clock position, and not seeing many textures again.

14
23:51:58,666 --> 23:52:08,989
They're just really stark across the flat part of that infilling of Mare Inginii and the textures at the

15
23:52:10,868 --> 23:52:17,269
nine o'clock are starting to be a little diffuse, but that could be an illumination condition.

16
23:52:18,710 --> 23:52:25,271
I talked about those contacts again, it just really stick out to me at that three o'clock between the inbaying and the hills.

17
23:52:26,111 --> 23:52:31,312
And yeah, really just an amazing feature, good illumination for this one.

18
23:52:31,492 --> 23:52:36,633
And those swirls are pretty prominent as I talked about in that mid to light tone gray.

### Transcript 004

1
23:52:04,310 --> 23:52:07,652
All right, I am going to do a recording of mare ingenii.

2
23:52:07,672 --> 23:52:10,774
So I am looking at the crater.

3
23:52:11,674 --> 23:52:15,937
It is partway down to the South Pole.

4
23:52:16,057 --> 23:52:25,002
It's really easy to see the swirling that we have in mare ingenii here that looks like white streaks, curly, swirly streaks going across.

5
23:52:25,702 --> 23:52:31,826
It seems like those swirls are most prevalent in the bottom half of that mare field.

6
23:52:34,643 --> 23:52:40,325
As you go up a little higher, actually the whole, it almost looks like an eyeball.

7
23:52:40,505 --> 23:52:45,567
And so if you see that darker part of the mare pond, it is darker in color.

8
23:52:45,587 --> 23:52:47,808
It doesn't really have as many of those swirls.

9
23:52:48,188 --> 23:52:52,250
But when you look around the outside, it's almost like where the iris of the eye would be.

10
23:52:52,690 --> 23:52:56,451
You can see those swirls very similarly to the veins that you would see in your eye.

11
23:52:59,315 --> 23:53:05,299
The texture along the right side of the crater, it's sort of a rubbly texture.

12
23:53:06,620 --> 23:53:12,123
You can tell that there's just a lot of broken down material near where the crater rim would have been.

13
23:53:12,143 --> 23:53:23,530
And the interesting thing is also just looking at this, I see a lot of that orange brown rusty color that matches some of the other mare infills that we see in South Pole Lake and Basin.

14
23:53:26,420 --> 23:53:36,412
It's really cool to see these swirls in exactly where they're supposed to be and they really do look similar to what we are seeing in Muscoviense as well.

### Transcript 005

1
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,691
Hello, perfect.

2
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:07,374
This is Marie making a recording of Crookes Crater.

3
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:15,580
And so I am looking at the crater with my eyes just out the window.

4
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,183
I can see that it is partway between Jackson Crater and Apollo Basin.

5
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:27,388
The Crookes Crater, you can see that it has an injected blanket and a couple of rays that come out.

6
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:33,884
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is very white compared to the surrounding as it's very bright.

7
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:46,268
Um, and almost looks, um, see, it is a, it is very similar in size.

8
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:51,730
It almost looks like the majority of the race system could fit inside, um, Apollo basin.

9
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,172
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is about that size.

10
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,018
It's very bright.

11
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,379
It's very white.

12
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:05,203
I can't really see any shadows here based on our geometry because I'm essentially looking straight down on it.

13
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:15,810
I can't really see much structure to it, but you do see that white circle interior of the crater.

14
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,534
It does stand out as brighter from the ejecta blanket.

15
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:35,586
Um, it does look like it is the, um, it almost looks like a ejecta, an ejecta ray from Jackson actually goes over it.

16
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:40,649
Um, and it looks very much like a, um, it just passes right through.

17
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,414
So I think that it is underneath one of those rays that is coming down from Jackson crater.

18
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:46,474
Um,

19
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:59,399
It's really neat to see all these bright spots with all these rays right now in this lighting and really excited to move on to our next target.

### Transcript 006

1
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:06,228
This is Marie making observations with the camera.

2
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,869
I'm trying to find Bose Ballot.

3
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,651
Bose Ballot.

4
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,471
Nope.

5
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:12,272
Bose and Bhabha.

6
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,572
Crater right now.

7
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:15,253
Craters.

8
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:24,119
I know that they're below Apollo Basin, but it's actually, at this lighting, it's really hard to pull them out because of the morphology is making it

9
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:29,137
more difficult to find exactly where the craters are.

10
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:46,326
And so what I'm doing instead is I'm just going to take a bunch of pictures of this bottom rim below Apollo Basin at the highest resolution that I can and try hopefully that you'll be able to see.

11
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,147
So I'm sure that I will have captured it.

12
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,282
might not be in the middle of the frame.

13
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:17,208
Yeah, without that defining morphology, it's actually pretty difficult to see, but I can still see a lot of that rusty brown color down here, and so the rims of the craters aren't as well pronounced, and so it's definitely a more difficult one to find, but hopefully the pictures help.

### Transcript 007

1
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,009
All right, looking forward to this.

2
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:10,876
I've got I think one more target here before Earthset and I can see Earth coming up on the on the side of the moon here.

3
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,257
But before we get there.

4
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:22,095
Really want to take the opportunity to describe this beautiful whole moon view I'm getting Wow, okay, where to even start?

5
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:31,178
We've got quite a variation of Albedo as the earth is approaching the sort of the limb of the moon and

6
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,721
Wow, it looks, you know, much brighter white.

7
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:42,966
You see, you know, crater array systems from several craters extending across the surface, and they really pop in this illumination profile.

8
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:57,816
You know, to the south, I got a great view here of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, starting to see that, you know, darker, grayer material in that beautiful SPA really pop out, and inside of it is

9
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:10,245
a series of other craters, some of which have dark smooth interiors and some of which have even darker patches that look like some of the mare patches.

10
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:25,896
There's one crater there that actually has patches of mare, several discrete patches of mare, whereas a few of the other craters within SPA have maybe more traditional, looks like mare infill there.

11
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:32,419
I'll tell you, it really is a beautiful view here.

12
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:43,608
I'm starting to see, I think, Muscovians, which I know is a really exciting science target.

13
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:49,633
Jackson Crater pops in the middle where you see a sharp crater rim for Jackson.

14
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:52,135
And the rays almost look like a star.

15
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:54,657
I see kind of like five rays coming out.

16
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:57,159
The ray to the north.

17
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:09,303
Is fainter- the other four rays- really are coming out- kind of like in an even spread and even spacing radially out from the center of.

18
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:11,724
Of Jackson crater there-

19
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:31,202
Wow yeah I mean of course toward the Terminator we're starting to see some more distinct shadowing there and again like that morphology really pops on the west side whereas on the east side I'm able to pick up that really bright albedo color.

20
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:43,673
And it's just really a spectacular view of these different albedo provinces that I see moving from east to west.

21
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:50,182
I'm starting to see Earth get a lot closer to the limb of the moon here, so I know I've got to transition to Earthset.

22
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:55,945
Wowee, this is a great view and really fortunate to be able to see it here.

23
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:59,406
Last thing I'll say is I think I missed the textures.

24
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:12,710
On the east side, the texture really is starting to get pretty, you know, of course washed out due to the illumination conditions there, so it looks pretty smooth to my eye, but wow does that texture start to pop as you're looking at the Terminator.

25
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:22,374
It's a beautiful view here, and as we're getting ready to see Earthset, I just want to say, you know, thanks and see you on the other side.

### Transcript 008

1
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,819
All right, this is our target number nine.

2
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,459
We're describing the moon in general.

3
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:17,422
And as I'll do this, I'm going to start big and then go from north to south and left to right.

4
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:27,604
So overall, on this side of the moon, I see a combination of grays and whites with a few mares in the south

5
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:32,223
east and a few towards the south-southwest.

6
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:36,585
That south-east is Orientale and south-southwest is Apollo Basin.

7
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:43,748
We still have a few mares to the north-east over there on the edge of the moon.

8
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:49,570
Now as I go from north to south and left to right, I'm seeing in the

9
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:58,683
top left quadrant there, medium gray type of fields with spots of white, very distinct blotches.

10
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:02,165
They could be craters, they could be upturned regolith.

11
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:09,470
And as I'm going from left to right in the north side, I'm seeing some cratering that is horizontal.

12
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:19,177
And there's a few white spots towards the north-north side, two of them that look like a pair in a vertical linear fashion.

13
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:34,133
And then as I go to the right, I'm seeing more white spots that are circular in nature, almost look like a pepperoni pizza with white pepperonis on a gray piece of cheese.

14
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:40,255
And now I'm finally getting to the dark mares on the edge on the east side or right side of my view.

15
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:47,257
And those are kind of like algae looking dark mares.

16
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,720
very thin along the eastern side and the northeast quadrant.

17
00:34:53,461 --> 00:35:11,729
Coming back to the left, I'm glossing over, it looks like Oum crater with all of its rays, and then going to the middle point of the north side, there is more dark gray regolith versus white patches.

18
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,810
Then going over to Oum, I'm seeing

19
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:24,462
the star pattern rays, and then the features of the craters start to become more prominent as I'm looking right where Jackson is and then to the west side.

20
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:30,746
It looks very more distinct from an albedo perspective and feature perspective.

21
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:39,893
Now along the equatorial line, I see those craters on the left side, and they are more distinct but smaller in the equator.

22
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:49,394
And then as I go towards the middle, there's a large crater directly in front of us, normal to our view, that has an interesting star pattern, four points.

23
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:52,475
It's making an X that's in a diagonal form.

24
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:57,837
And then over to the right of that, there's a big white blotch in between Oum and Orientale.

25
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:00,837
That's a very interesting feature.

26
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:03,198
And then going to the southern hemisphere,

27
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:18,223
Orientale has a bunch of bright splotches to its 10 o'clock position and sweeping in the northwest quadrant of Orientale and then going back to the center in the mid latitudes of the south hemisphere.

28
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:32,330
There's not many features that I could tell probably because of my viewing angle as far as terrain but lots of albedo patches that are from the northwest down to the southeast and that kind of hovers right on the northeast side of

29
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:33,567
Apollo Basin.

30
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:39,909
And then as I get to Apollo Basin, there's a lot more dark gray albedo to the southwest.

31
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:50,212
And then there's more cratering that is seen because of the viewing angle to the southwest hemisphere that kind of blends into the Terminator.

### Transcript 009

1
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,705
Alright, moving on to target number 15.

2
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:04,827
We're going to Jackson.

3
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,290
So I'm looking at Jackson now.

4
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:16,262
I've certainly been able to locate it given some of the surrounding landmarks to focus in on it.

5
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,506
If I do look down at my LTP, I tend to

6
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:25,337
lose exactly where it's at, so it takes some relocating every time I look back out.

7
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:34,565
So I'm gonna concentrate on just describing Jackson and then I'll take a look and make sure I didn't miss anything in the actions or the cue card.

8
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:41,492
So just looking at Jackson for its shape and size, super circular,

9
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:42,778
crater.

10
00:40:43,279 --> 00:41:03,312
I do pick up in this illumination condition some of the central peak that looks at the bottom of Jackson and get a lot of the terracing, particularly to the nine o'clock position in our current orientation of the window with 12 o'clock being up the lunar north.

11
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:07,535
Now also mention that

12
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,352
I see some distinct rays from Jackson.

13
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:14,153
I think that was one of the actions out of the LTP.

14
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:27,781
I see distinct rays at the four o'clock and the 10 o'clock that extend about five to six Jackson diameters away from Jackson itself.

15
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:44,162
And those kind of peter out or I lose that distinct ray colorization when it impacts or when it gets into some other impacts that are further extent, but also have some, some rays associated with them.

16
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:51,947
But Jackson for sure is, has some distinct rays as my eyes have become adapted to the lighting environment.

17
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:57,477
There also maybe is a subtle ray that goes down to the seven o'clock.

18
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:05,980
It's less prominent, but definitely see some of those light tone rays coming from Jackson.

19
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:13,422
Now they're light tone, but they're not in this illumination condition any lighter than the bottom of Jackson.

20
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:20,645
So if I was to describe the three color tones that I just outlined there, the lightest is the

21
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:30,297
the bottom of Jackson and then the light rays are the next color tone and then there's kind of the gray background that is the surrounding terrain.

22
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:38,247
And so I just wanted to enumerate that tonal difference in three distinct broad categories.

23
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,866
Um, let me take a look at the LTP again here real quick.

24
00:42:42,906 --> 00:42:49,949
So that covers the color, some of those albedos, um, and that tonal difference that I was talking about and texture.

25
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:57,691
Yeah, the biggest texture thing that sticks out with Jackson to me, um, is the terracing and that central peak.

26
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:05,614
Um, don't see any specific texture in those rays I described, but the terracing is pretty, um,

27
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,873
dramatic, even though it's a small crater, it stands out because of that terracing.

28
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,795
And I think that covers it for the LTP.

29
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,336
Let me take one last look.

30
00:43:19,257 --> 00:43:32,283
Yeah, the relationship with the rays across the surface are, as I described, pretty prominent within two or three crater diameters of Jackson and then start to fall off as you get to those five or six crater diameters away.

31
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,424
That's it with Jackson.

32
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:35,265
Moving on to the next one.

### Transcript 010

1
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,351
Okay, this is Christina Cook.

2
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,633
I'm doing an observation for site 19 Jackson Crater.

3
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:17,799
Visually tracing the rays from the center of the crater, I'm gonna describe how they change as they move away.

4
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:30,567
I think a really neat thing about Jackson Crater is they are very predominant rays, and they all kind of peter out at about the same radius from the center of Jackson Crater, which makes it almost look like a starfish.

5
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:38,315
that distance from the center of the crater is probably about six crater diameters away, five to six crater diameters away.

6
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:46,541
One ray that extends a little farther than that is the one that goes down to what I think is Korolyov

7
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:56,048
crater or basin and a high albedo little spot that's above it, that ray is a little longer than the others.

8
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:06,156
It almost also appears as if two rays that go out the top of Jackson Crater a little bit towards the northeast almost crisscross.

9
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:11,541
Difficult to say whether that's albedo or if that's terrain that makes it look like it, but

10
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:23,002
there is kind of an area on the northeast and triangular shaped area of Jackson that kind of is almost like a continuous ray blob, if you will.

11
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:31,570
Like I said, they all kind of peter out after that or turn very, very light and are more difficult to trace after that.

12
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:43,381
And I think that's all I'm going to talk about for Jackson.

### Transcript 011

1
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,222
Christina here, working through my targeting.

2
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:08,966
Next up is number 16, Oppenheimer.

3
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:19,436
I am looking through the camera at the moment, and so I can get pretty close, zoomed in.

4
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,980
Oppenheimer and Apollo Basin right next to each other.

5
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,822
I'll say the first thing that stands out to me

6
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:28,258
are the color tones.

7
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:39,842
Oppenheimer has kind of this reddish hue to it, with its mare being more like almost like a dark purple.

8
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:44,844
And the mares that are really standing out to me are the kind of three

9
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:51,207
to the left side of the crater.

10
00:45:52,489 --> 00:46:11,047
And then as you go more towards Apollo Basin, the color tone changes pretty significantly because you have this big ray, this light-toned ray that's coming from Crooks that is just almost cutting

11
00:46:12,474 --> 00:46:13,254
Oppenheimer in half.

12
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:29,341
It's going kind of close to straight up and down through the crater and proceeds double the length, at least, past the crater as well.

13
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:39,205
And in that ray, there's actually two tones of this kind of lighter hue that's also about equal

14
00:46:41,290 --> 00:47:01,398
on so i'll say that if you kind of split that ray in half vertically on the left side of it has this more of a maybe we'll call it like a tan like a a tanner browner light toned color and then on the right side of it closer to apollo basin it's definitely more of a

15
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:08,676
a lighter tan, I'll say, but there's a little bit of tonal difference with the lighter color closer towards Apollo Basin.

16
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:18,244
And then as you move more towards Apollo Basin, you have a reddish tone, but it's a little bit lighter than what I'm seeing in Oppenheimer.

17
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:26,312
And then the Mare also, instead of like the dark purples, if you call it like a little bit of darker purple in the Mare,

18
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:32,518
In Oppenheimer, in Apollo, it's more of like a bluer in the mare.

19
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:38,182
And then go into texture.

20
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:47,388
Let's see, Oppenheimer is a little bit, maybe I'd call it rougher than Apollo overall.

21
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:04,887
And I'm definitely seeing these kind of finer structures that are at the base, at the kind of basin of Oppenheimer.

22
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:13,653
And I can even see them in my LTP, but yeah, they're not present in Apollo either.

23
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:22,320
So I just see these kind of linear fractures and structures in Oppenheimer at the, at its basin.

24
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:40,078
Overall though, these kind of the margins of the mare, I would say, are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than Apollo.

25
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:47,903
Like there are some margins, like I said, those three kind of primary mare are what stands out.

26
00:48:49,044 --> 00:48:50,405
And what I mean by that,

27
00:48:53,462 --> 00:49:03,470
are there's the very circular, so if you're talking about Oppenheimer on the kind of left side of it, there's a really circular mare which has like two

28
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,361
it kind of horizontal notches to it.

29
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:12,942
And then below that, a little to the left, you have a little bit of a smaller splotch.

30
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:18,483
And then a little bit below that, a little bit more to the right, there's kind of a dark, diffuse mare patch.

31
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:30,246
Whereas Apollo, it's very clear that there are, instead of, like I said, the margins are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than they are in Apollo.

32
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:33,807
The Apollo mare is very clear,

33
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:43,998
lineation and differentiation between the light and the dark of the mare and the light-toned surrounding area.

### Transcript 012

1
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:01,808
Christina here.

2
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:06,789
Moving on to my next target, which is Apollo Basin, target number 17.

3
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:19,692
I did a lot of descriptions on Apollo Basin when I compared it to Oppenheimer for target 16, but I'm going to continue on focusing on Apollo Basin.

4
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:23,953
So the first thing I'll note is the color tones.

5
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:30,515
And there doesn't seem to be a significant color tone difference in

6
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:51,782
The kind of inner ring of the basin and the exterior ring of the basin They seem to be around the same color tone, which is in the mare this dark blue Very dark kind of black blue color and then everything else which has a slight kind of reddish gray

7
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:53,179
tone to it.

8
00:50:54,139 --> 00:51:11,589
With the exception of maybe like three pretty bright craters that stand out, the one that stands out the most is kind of the northeast of the mare that's inside of the inner basin.

9
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:25,224
and it stands out because it has rays that are maybe like four rays that are clearly cutting across that mare, that irregular shaped mare, and it seems like those rays are

10
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:33,673
you know, they're very clear because they have a contrast in the dark mares because they're such light tone.

11
00:51:34,093 --> 00:51:38,116
And then they continue on, but the end of it is a little bit diffuse.

12
00:51:38,236 --> 00:51:42,740
I know I can't see those rays on the other side of that inner ring.

13
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,262
So they seem to be constrained in some way to the inner ring.

14
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:52,026
And their direction is kind of north,

15
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:58,804
northwest, cutting diagonally down and across.

16
00:52:00,265 --> 00:52:13,495
And then the other two brighter craters that stand out are outside of that inner basin and slightly to the east of the dark mare patch that's

17
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,231
on the left side of the basin.

18
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:21,855
If you're looking at it like a face, it's the left eye of that mare patch.

19
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:24,376
It's a little bit to the right of it.

20
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:34,842
And then if you're looking at the smile, right above, north of the smile, that's the other kind of bright crater.

21
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,984
So there's that kind of three bright craters that stand out.

22
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:42,507
And I've kind of tried to describe them in association with the mare, but hopefully that comes through in the pictures.

23
00:52:50,803 --> 00:53:00,608
In general, in terms of the texture, Apollo Basin seems a lot smoother, especially in the kind of mare regions.

24
00:53:02,248 --> 00:53:14,694
Definitely seems like they're a little bit more of a flow or a mantled type of smooth look versus Oppenheimer, which has a little bit more ruggedness to it.

25
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:26,926
And like I mentioned, there's more contrast and sharpness in the boundaries of those dark patches in Apollo Basin than Oppenheimer.

26
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:43,773
And the last thing I'll say is it does seem like Oppenheimer is

27
00:53:47,391 --> 00:54:01,616
kind of physically on top of Apollo Basin, like it's cutting into it, it's cutting off a little bit of the margin, and then there's these rays that are cutting straight through from a crater above.

### Transcript 013

1
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:05,158
All right, moving on to target 20, the Poincaré Crater region.

2
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:16,647
I've been staring at this one for a little bit now before I started this recording, and I'm looking for that stratigraphic relationship that's called out for this basin.

3
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:30,118
I totally understand that it's within SPA, or at least in a Western region of SPA, but I'm trying to look for this resurface volcanism

4
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:32,864
And it's just not standing out to me.

5
01:05:32,924 --> 01:05:34,905
Maybe it's the illumination condition on this one.

6
01:05:34,925 --> 01:05:47,933
Maybe it's because of that being near the Terminator, but I'm not picking up on the things, the actions that are outlined in the LTP.

7
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:59,140
Color's pretty diffuse across this one, not picking up any kind of color differentiation that, at least from my eyes and at this, you know, without a,

8
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,079
optical device to get any closer in on it.

9
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:06,340
Wrinkle ridges, not seeing any.

10
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:13,042
The basin rings, I can't see that it's a basin, but I kind of have to squint to see that in that area.

11
01:06:14,062 --> 01:06:19,884
And the mari relationships, just because it's all tonal, about the same down there in this illumination conditions.

12
01:06:21,765 --> 01:06:22,385
Not, not

13
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:26,004
not anything's really standing out to me.

14
01:06:26,104 --> 01:06:38,419
So sorry, this one might be a dud for you guys, but really not seeing anything standing out in that area that gets me at the stratigraphic relationship or the volcanic activity in this area.

15
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,003
Sorry about that one, but moving on to the next one.

### Transcript 014

1
01:25:01,114 --> 01:25:07,996
Jeremy here doing my next observation, which is Target 24, South Pole Aitken Basin.

2
01:25:08,897 --> 01:25:29,804
Reid has the camera right now, so I'm just using my eyes, looking at this pretty big region, which is most of the south, you know, south side of the moon, except what's kind of cut off by the Terminator on my west.

3
01:25:31,362 --> 01:25:32,723
The first thing I'll note is the color.

4
01:25:32,743 --> 01:25:44,251
The thing that stands out the most with the color is the light-toned ray that's coming straight kind of through the margin of Apollo Basin and Oppenheimer.

5
01:25:44,991 --> 01:25:46,612
It continues all the way down.

6
01:25:46,632 --> 01:25:49,755
I can't necessarily say I see the end of it.

7
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:53,097
This keeps continuing down through the moon.

8
01:25:56,018 --> 01:26:08,861
Maybe it kind of goes, it follows a linear trajectory and then maybe has one fork in it that's forking towards the west.

9
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:12,222
But that light tone is pretty clear.

10
01:26:12,782 --> 01:26:16,903
The dark mare patches are also, in contrast, stand out.

11
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:33,355
Apollo Basin, dark blue mare, and then that's a similar kind of tone in mare to maybe a little bit of Leibniz crater.

12
01:26:35,176 --> 01:26:45,263
And then looking more towards the Terminator, maybe a little bit also in some of the swirls of Injani have a little bit of that dark blue as well.

13
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:51,071
and then things are a little bit more lost from color towards the terminator.

14
01:26:54,470 --> 01:27:00,232
And then color-wise, again, the redder tones in Apollo Basin are standing out.

15
01:27:01,813 --> 01:27:07,535
And then also there's some like reddish tones in Mare Anjanai too.

16
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:12,477
It's got that right above the margin on the north side.

17
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:15,919
It almost seems like a little bit of like a red

18
01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:28,045
I don't want to say glow, but a little bit of a diffuse red color that emanates out from the north of Injani, which is really pretty spectacular.

19
01:27:28,245 --> 01:27:32,008
And it's a little bit in the swirls as well, that red tone.

20
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:37,491
Reddish, orangish, muted colors.

21
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:39,212
Not very bright, but muted.

22
01:27:41,293 --> 01:27:44,755
In terms of structures, I can roughly see the

23
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:51,698
You're going to call the boundary of South Pohegan Basin at the at the northern side.

24
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:59,029
And then some of these right at the terminator that roughness pops out.

25
01:28:01,392 --> 01:28:03,495
I'm not entirely sure what crater.

26
01:28:05,767 --> 01:28:12,074
Sorry, what ridges is standing out to me right at that terminator, but it's to the east of engine.

27
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:19,082
I definitely looks like it's more, uh, an elongated ridge and that's, that's pretty clear.

28
01:28:19,623 --> 01:28:20,564
Um, it's really cool.

29
01:28:20,604 --> 01:28:24,088
All that lighting makes that topography stand out.

### Transcript 015

1
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,494
Alright, my second time looking at Mare Inginii and swirls.

2
01:45:05,155 --> 01:45:09,139
Hopefully my crew members over there are taking some good pictures of this photometric effect.

3
01:45:10,394 --> 01:45:22,965
I'm seeing a little bit, again, this is target 28, Mari Injani's a little bit smaller than our Apollo base, and that's how I index off of Apollo base, and then just kind of move to the left in the current orientation.

4
01:45:23,005 --> 01:45:24,026
That's how I pick that up.

5
01:45:24,946 --> 01:45:34,554
The boundary of Mari Injani's may be a little bit more distinct in this illumination condition, so I'm glad I trained my eyes back on this a second time.

6
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:47,006
I am still not seeing any kind of like hue or like red or yellows or any kind of color difference like that.

7
01:45:47,026 --> 01:45:51,592
I'm just mostly seeing some gray tonal difference so the albedo changes.

8
01:45:52,333 --> 01:46:07,438
between those three distinct albedos that I talked about before, kind of a light tone swirl, medium tone swirl, and then all set across the darker backdrop of the Mare Inginii region.

9
01:46:08,919 --> 01:46:11,600
The slope now has changed a little bit from

10
01:46:12,205 --> 01:46:23,812
What I think I described earlier, the slopes and the structure that really stands out to me is now mostly at the six to nine o'clock.

11
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:37,319
I'm starting to pick up a lot of different features that I didn't see the first time I looked at Mari Injani and really starting to appreciate for how much that Terminator coming closer and the

12
01:46:39,164 --> 01:46:46,047
The photometric effect is making the observation different, but hasn't made the color any different, if that makes sense.

13
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,687
So the colors are about the same.

14
01:46:47,747 --> 01:46:54,430
I'm just getting more textural differences, particularly across the southern portion of that crater.

15
01:46:56,598 --> 01:47:09,976
The embayment that I described before, especially at the three o'clock into the hills at the three o'clock with those kind of like bunny ears or the Mickey Mouse ears that are headed towards the three o'clock.

16
01:47:11,111 --> 01:47:13,312
Not as sharp as when I first observed them.

17
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,912
It was an earlier target.

18
01:47:14,972 --> 01:47:15,972
I forget which number.

19
01:47:16,873 --> 01:47:22,614
But I'm glad I trained my eyes back on this one and hopefully gave you guys some good observations.

20
01:47:22,694 --> 01:47:32,856
But those photos are really going to be key to hopefully zoom in and determine any kind of other photometric effect that might be going on.

21
01:47:33,037 --> 01:47:39,018
So thanks for turning me on to this one a second time and hopefully that observations helped.

### Transcript 016

1
01:50:02,122 --> 01:50:16,885
Okay, here I am at window two and I think the next target on my list here is Buys-Ballott and I remember this one from training and I'll be honest, I'm pretty glad I get the chance to observe it because of

2
01:50:17,607 --> 01:50:18,708
how unique it is.

3
01:50:18,728 --> 01:50:25,736
It does have that kind of arrowhead shape where the point of the arrow is pointing to the south.

4
01:50:26,697 --> 01:50:37,389
It has a long linear ridge in the middle that I would have believed is a central peak but it's so linear and stretched out it looks like it's rising above a relatively smooth terrain here.

5
01:50:39,692 --> 01:50:49,499
Speaking of that smooth terrain, sort of the like upper northern end of the bottom of the crater looks pretty smooth.

6
01:50:50,099 --> 01:50:57,684
It's got like some younger fresher craters that look like they've formed in the smooth mare.

7
01:50:58,024 --> 01:50:58,585
They're dark

8
01:50:59,385 --> 01:51:00,286
smooth patch.

9
01:51:01,747 --> 01:51:05,909
But it that that sort of northern part is really, you know, quite smooth.

10
01:51:05,949 --> 01:51:12,133
And then as you move to the south toward, you know, the other end of that linear ridge in the middle of the crater, it looks like rougher terrain.

11
01:51:12,553 --> 01:51:16,756
And it almost looks like that rougher terrain ends in sort of like an arc.

12
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:22,301
that starts in the west, goes slightly up to the north, then goes back down to the east.

13
01:51:23,142 --> 01:51:29,287
There's also another little, like, arc, almost like a slump or something on the east side of the crater.

14
01:51:29,307 --> 01:51:41,078
I would say the east side of the crater looks, I think, like a shallower slope, whereas the west side is a steeper slope.

15
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:53,574
really interesting diversity in this crater from the sort of lumpy, hummocky texture to the south and the smooth texture to the north.

16
01:51:54,495 --> 01:52:07,200
As for like color and albedo, I'd say the fresher or the smoother stuff is grayer, much grayer than the southern edge, which is like a lighter gray tone.

17
01:52:08,276 --> 01:52:22,179
So I definitely see a kind of a distinct color difference there Looks like you guys want me to draw some comparisons about Lacus luxuriate to the south Man, that thing is is hard to kind of see and pick out.

18
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:32,221
It's much less Topographically notable than Buys-Ballott But really interesting feature here and

19
01:52:35,226 --> 01:52:38,088
making sure I'm not missing any of your requests.

20
01:52:39,729 --> 01:52:41,850
Yeah, the texture I think I covered.

21
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:50,075
We got the steep slope to the west, the shallower slope to the east that really has that hummocky slump-like terrain.

22
01:52:53,537 --> 01:52:55,698
And again, rougher to the south.

23
01:52:55,778 --> 01:53:02,762
And I mean, I still see some tiny fresher craters there in the southern rougher patch.

24
01:53:04,371 --> 01:53:10,318
but much different than the sort of other smooth material in Lacus Luxuriae.

25
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:14,263
Really interesting crater and I'm excited to see what you guys make of it.

### Transcript 017

1
02:00:02,088 --> 02:00:04,769
Okay, back at Dewar Crater.

2
02:00:04,789 --> 02:00:07,531
I'm fortunate to get a chance to look at this twice.

3
02:00:07,551 --> 02:00:16,515
I know these different illumination conditions that I'm experiencing now might bring out some different information about morphology and about

4
02:00:17,555 --> 02:00:19,656
composition, as I recall.

5
02:00:20,796 --> 02:00:22,496
So let me take a look here.

6
02:00:22,976 --> 02:00:25,037
Again, we have Dewar Crater here.

7
02:00:26,057 --> 02:00:36,219
And again, the albedo anomaly that I think I'm looking for here comes out to the south, to the east, and actually maybe in this viewing geometry, maybe more to the north than I had initially thought.

8
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:43,661
I'm still not seeing, you know, a ton jump out at me in terms of morphology of this albedo anomaly.

9
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:47,122
Dewar Crater has a pretty sharp and defined rim from what I

10
02:00:47,402 --> 02:00:55,273
As you can see here, it looks like sort of the western edge of Dewar Crater.

11
02:00:57,452 --> 02:01:06,854
let's see, a bit, um, maybe more like slumped than the, than the right side, than the east side of, of Dewar crater.

12
02:01:07,454 --> 02:01:11,775
Um, the mid, but it is a pretty, um, sharp and beautiful crater boundary there.

13
02:01:12,315 --> 02:01:23,697
Um, again, I'm seeing the albedo anomaly over top of it, some smaller craters, um, that are significantly smaller than Dewar all the way down to almost the resolution that I can see with my naked eye here.

14
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:39,433
seem to be on top of the albedo anomaly, just because they do appear to be sort of like brighter and don't seem to have that darker, that darker colored material on top of the brighter craters.

15
02:01:40,453 --> 02:01:51,823
One of the younger craters at about three o'clock from Dewar sticks out particularly to my eye as being lighter in albedo than what it's sitting on, which is that darker material I described earlier.

16
02:01:52,702 --> 02:02:17,238
Like I said earlier, I don't really see any morphology or texture that underlies the dark albedo material, but I do definitely see what you guys are directing me to look at, which is some really interesting material that, again, kind of looks like somebody threw a powder onto a surface, and it sort of originates from about halfway through Dewar Crater itself.

17
02:02:19,942 --> 02:02:21,404
Thanks, and I'll move on to the next target.

### Transcript 018

1
02:05:02,082 --> 02:05:02,902
Alright, this is Maria.

2
02:05:02,943 --> 02:05:13,989
I'm gonna again talk through the Terminator because I did it once already but completely missed it the last time so I guess I'll just take a new mosaic.

3
02:05:14,609 --> 02:05:17,310
So I'm gonna just take a higher resolution one.

4
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:23,454
I did just finish a mosaic before but I will do another one because I want to talk through the recording.

5
02:05:26,036 --> 02:05:28,837
So, I am snaking my way up.

6
02:05:29,698 --> 02:05:31,339
Oh, there's Mare Injunai.

7
02:05:31,379 --> 02:05:33,680
I can really see that in the swirls there.

8
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:39,282
I'm working my way up from there, and then I'm going to snake over closer to the Terminator.

9
02:05:39,723 --> 02:05:44,625
Right now, the Terminator is not in my view, but I'll get over there.

10
02:05:44,685 --> 02:05:53,469
It's really interesting to see the depressions, the difference in the amount of depression that you see in these critters.

11
02:05:54,525 --> 02:05:56,187
as I work my way up here.

12
02:05:56,267 --> 02:05:58,109
I'm up near the North Pole now.

13
02:05:58,289 --> 02:06:00,551
I'm gonna snake over a little bit more to the left.

14
02:06:02,453 --> 02:06:07,157
Sounds like they're working on the toilet behind me, but glad they can get that checked out.

15
02:06:07,177 --> 02:06:09,820
Now I'm up in Muscoviense.

16
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,461
I'm working my way back down.

17
02:06:11,902 --> 02:06:15,525
There's that little tiny mare-filled crater not too far below it.

18
02:06:16,886 --> 02:06:18,568
Now I'm working my way back down.

19
02:06:20,275 --> 02:06:27,720
Making sure that I have- oh, now I'm back at Jules Verne with those scarps.

20
02:06:27,981 --> 02:06:29,202
Back over to the left.

21
02:06:30,222 --> 02:06:32,304
And now I have the Terminator in view.

22
02:06:32,404 --> 02:06:33,665
There I am at that.

23
02:06:49,501 --> 02:06:56,411
make sure that I get and now the moon is the earth is back in that view also absolutely incredible view here

### Transcript 019

1
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:03,887
This is Marie calling from the moon.

2
02:10:03,907 --> 02:10:05,615
I was just looking out the...

3
02:10:06,571 --> 02:10:09,012
out the window and I think I saw an impact flash.

4
02:10:33,238 --> 02:10:34,738
I can't forget the name of it because I

5
02:10:35,238 --> 02:10:56,337
don't not looking at my lunar targeting plan right now but it was just off of there over the side of the Terminator it was just really quick it lasts about a second not even but it did have like sort of a yellowish whitish hue it just came in really quickly right during the Jules Verne observation

6
02:10:58,526 --> 02:10:59,048
And that's it.

7
02:10:59,629 --> 02:11:07,009
Hope you guys can, you know, use our LRO friends to help us find out if we can see our brand new impact crater.
