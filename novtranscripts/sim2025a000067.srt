1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:04,147
Okay, this is Kelsey here.

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:11,076
It is 1546 and I'm just coming on to observe the moon here.

3
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,037
Excited to be here.

4
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:23,952
My first target here is taking a look at the entire moon and I have to say this isn't the objective of the task but I see the Earth as well and wow does it look beautiful.

5
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:30,240
So orient myself to the moon here is I think what I'm supposed to be doing.

6
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:37,553
I will say it is gorgeous and as the LTP says it is indeed not made of cheese.

7
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:47,318
I do see color variations starting to pop out you know I see at first glance I see the bright white

8
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:54,076
Craters really popping out, especially those beautiful rays extending across the entire face of the moon that I'm looking at.

9
00:00:54,737 --> 00:01:02,252
I see what I believe to be South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, which looks a little browner in color and inside SPA.

10
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:08,102
There seems to be dark mare patches, but not all the patches are the same color dark.

11
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,286
They really range in albedo across the spectrum of grays.

12
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:26,280
Muscoviens is right there popping out beautiful at about 10.30 PM on a clock, and I am facing my head where lunar north is to the top of my head right now.

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,986
I will say the standout features that I see I kind of already mentioned are

14
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:39,725
Muscovians, the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, and just the sheer variety of albedo you see across the surface.

15
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:44,237
I'm going to go into my geography review tab here.

16
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,224
just take a look.

17
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:57,838
And what I'm really seeing is Jackson and the rays of Jackson extending beautifully over this far side view.

18
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:09,533
I am also seeing crater rays extend in places all the way down into the South Pelican Basin and across the South Pelican Basin.

19
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:20,235
I see Aiken popping out to the sort of upper left, maybe, again, like 1030 if the clock is SPA and I am pointed to the north.

20
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:23,038
And it really pops out beautifully.

21
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:31,667
And I actually see some albedo, some bright white material that's extending out to sort of the, again, the southwest of Aiken crater.

22
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:36,111
Again, my orientation is that I am facing toward the lunar north pole.

23
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,849
Let's see, what else did you want me to cover in this description?

24
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,693
Comparison of features across the globe.

25
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:54,921
I definitely see what you guys are talking about, about illumination angle and what you can tease out on the surface of the moon.

26
00:02:54,981 --> 00:03:02,848
For example, sort of right in the middle of my view, I can just really see a ton of albedo variation from those craters and the crater rays.

27
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,494
But then as you look over sort of to the, again, Kelsey left side,

28
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:12,286
You see a lot more topography and morphology start to pop out.

29
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:19,675
You see crater rims really start distinctly over on the limb there.

30
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:26,785
And there's some beautiful views that I'm getting both of the albedo in the middle and the topography over on the left.

31
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:28,407
Let's see.

32
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:33,193
Starting to see Zolkowski crater pop out on the left here.

33
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,376
Looking forward to getting a view of that later.

34
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:40,523
I'll leave it here for now and go on to the next target.
