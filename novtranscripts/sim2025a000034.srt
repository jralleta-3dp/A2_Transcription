1
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:05,295
Alright, starting on my next one, I finished that Whole Moon.

2
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:20,133
I'm going to go to Aitken Crater Crater, and then what I'm going to be looking for here is the Compact Split Crater with Mare infill.

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:27,962
So I'm looking to see if I can see any evidence of that scarp, the Raka X scarp.

4
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:32,981
And so I want to get in the highest resolution that I can.

5
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:38,410
So let me focus in on...

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,454
There is Mari Injani.

7
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,414
There's Mari Injani.

8
00:00:54,031 --> 00:01:20,646
there oh I can definitely see those swirls now and I work my way up to the mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater and I can really see that and so what I can see when I look in this mare pond of Aitken Crater Crater I can see that high point pretty in the center the rim of the crater is not very well defined

9
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,296
but that mare pond is really well defined.

10
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:28,663
And if I look in there, I can see some later sort of swirling also in there.

11
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:33,869
There is the crater that is about the six o'clock position of that mare pond.

12
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:38,995
And, um, and a little bit above that, it's almost like an upside down octopus.

13
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,139
Uh, you can sort of see some of that coloring.

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,005
It looks like the mare pond sort of flows around the

15
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:58,819
It flows around the peak inside.

16
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,721
Why can't I think of that word right now?

17
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:05,326
And it has that little offshoot to the right from there.

18
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:11,392
Okay, so I'm definitely going to go try to look for that scarp right now.

19
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:16,857
I can see, almost looks like you can see those little swirls.

20
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,460
Let me see if I can maybe draw those in a second too.

21
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:25,528
But if I'm looking for that scarp, it is.

22
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:37,926
It looks like that scarp is sort of bisecting the crater next to it.

23
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:39,428
So I go there.

24
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,438
I go across to this crater and see if I can

25
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,321
Resolve that scarp.

26
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:52,745
I think that is the one.

27
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:53,706
There.

28
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:56,729
Okay, again.

29
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,313
It's very...

30
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,716
I'm taking images of where it is.

31
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:07,320
It's very hard for me to resolve that right now in the light.

32
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:12,105
But I'm following the craters that it would be bisecting there.

33
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:23,271
But it really isn't popping out as evident without like some of the shadows that would make it pop out a little bit more if it were closer to the Terminator than it actually is.

34
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:29,019
And so I really can't see any of that tectonic activity there.

35
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:41,316
But it is worth looking for and hopefully, I wish we could definitely have seen that for you all.

36
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:45,568
Um, let's see.
