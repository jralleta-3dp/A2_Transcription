1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,991
Okay, Kelsey here.

2
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:05,716
Target 17, Dewar Crater Region Crater Region.

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,880
I will say that my voice recorder app is misbehaving.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,887
Last time only a power cycle fixed it, but if I power cycle, I will risk losing target 18, which is high priority.

5
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:24,398
So I am going to hope that my experience last time wins out and the recordings are still there, even if I can't hear them back.

6
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:28,283
So here I am, Dewar Crater Region is the next,

7
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,654
target I have.

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:36,603
Let's see on the LTP, it's kind of like on a line between Aitken Crater Crater and Muscovy End.

9
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:37,243
So I'm gonna follow it up.

10
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,625
Yep, I think I see it there.

11
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:41,749
So let me see, go to the 400 millimeter.

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:43,330
What am I looking for?

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,414
Low albedo anomaly, maybe cryptomare.

14
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,836
Okay, so let me see here.

15
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:58,168
All right, so in the window, I am actually, my head is pointing toward sort of the right east side again.

16
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:02,082
I understand it's the western limb, but it's to my east.

17
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:07,453
And so the camera is pointed 90 degrees from the last pictures I took.

18
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:09,296
I'm going to zoom in here.

19
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:13,805
Do a regional, yeah, really pops out beautifully in the zoom.

20
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:20,157
OK, going all the way to 400 here.

21
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:28,548
And in that zoom lens, I can really see there's a diffuse patch of that darker material.

22
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:31,071
Here, I'll get a picture of it.

23
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,898
I'll get a picture of it with some context here.

24
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,822
And let me see.

25
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:46,650
Yeah, so it looks, it is diffuse, and it's especially diffuse as you move out from it.

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,835
It's almost like several layers of diffusivity where it's darker in the middle,

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,144
and then slightly less dark, but still darker than the surrounding terrain coming out.

28
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:09,399
I think there are fewer craters on it than the surrounding area, suggesting, well, that doesn't make sense if it's Cryptomare, but I'm telling you, I don't really see a higher density of craters.

29
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:13,102
It's just kind of the same as the surrounding terrain.

30
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:17,447
So the only indication of anything really is that albedo color.

31
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,628
I don't even really see

32
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,931
relationship between the dark albedo and topography here.

33
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:27,167
Take a nice picture and I'll move on to the next high priority target.
