00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:35,682
There it is.

00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:50,603

00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:54,950
It's sort of around the 2 o'clock on the rim.

6
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,675
I can still see that the edge is a little bit hazier.

7
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:06,143
And maybe we should do the changeover, because it looks like they need a little bit of assistance here in the reconfiguration time.

00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:10,453
Yep.
