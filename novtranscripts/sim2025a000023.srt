1
00:00:02,225 --> 00:00:04,507
All right, Houston, Angela here.

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:12,055
I am, I was troubleshooting Kelsey's PCDs, so I definitely missed Babaloff.

3
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,799
Trying to get quickly back into Earthset, because I see it right now.

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,183
So let me get some pictures of Earthset.

5
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:24,587
And I'm taking them of the screen.

6
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,894
Yeah, okay, as I am,

7
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:41,843
Looking closer, you want me to focus on an Earth atmosphere.

8
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:48,589
I'm not seeing, it just looks like a perfect, clear-boundaried marble.

9
00:00:48,609 --> 00:01:02,303
Oh, yeah, maybe I'm seeing a little bit of blue reflection coming from, only I can totally see it when I'm zoomed in.

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:15,768
but perhaps a little bit of this kind of neon, maybe not neon, like a, how do I describe that?

11
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,194
Just like a true blue.

12
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:31,210
And I'm checking my camera viewfinder to make sure that that color comes through, but I'm definitely seeing some

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,501
blue.

14
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:52,957
This is hard.

15
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:58,043
In terms of atmospheric patterns, I see some swirling of moons.

16
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:07,035
The bright white of Antarctica is much of a truer white than the gray

17
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:33,445
of the of the highlands and so the the clouds and those are polar ice caps are a great comparison for a true white because now that I'm looking at those in comparison to the highlands especially when I'm kind of zooming out a little bit we'll call it the thing that's the the truest color is actually the

18
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:45,143
the dead center of Crooks is probably what I'm seeing as like the truest white when I compare it to the clouds on the Earth.

19
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:55,516
It's sad to see the Earthset behind the moon, but I know I'll see it on the other side.

20
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:59,922
I got some pictures

21
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:09,442
I'm just gonna make sure I get some of the all zoomed angles.

22
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:26,331
It's really great to have it have the lens zoomed in as I can watch it go but also kind of step back and see

23
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,126
with it, with my naked eye.

24
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:35,153
And this is the moment where the moon fully disappears.

25
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:47,050
That was a beautiful, beautiful thing that I just got to witness.

26
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:55,963
Okay.
