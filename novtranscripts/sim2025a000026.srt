1
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:06,074
All right, Angela, back with you, starting on Target 15, Apollo Basin.

2
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:16,849
Now, I talked a little bit about Apollo when I was describing Oppenheimer Basin, and I'm gonna continue to do so.

3
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:22,377
I'm gonna make sure I have some good full view pictures.

4
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:27,144
Body position wise, I am clocked slightly.

5
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:30,308
I'd be like 90 degrees to the right.

6
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:36,873
where the zero is the top upright windows of Orion.

7
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:57,240
So just took a few pictures focused on the fullest zoom out and now I'm kind of clocking in focusing on the margins between Apollo Basin and Oppenheimer Basin

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,691
And now I'm going to take a few pictures focused just directly on Apollo Basin, because that is the target I want to focus on.

9
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:10,897
Oh, this is fun to look at.

10
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:13,921
It's actually kind of hard to stabilize.

11
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,609
So I'm just going to not.

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,096
I'm just going to put my feet up to help stabilize myself.

13
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,662
As I'm zoomed in on Apollo Basin,

14
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:41,386
Um, it's really cool to see the, um, the bright mare crater that's above, if you call it like the eye, the right eye above that.

15
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:48,092
And it's got some really good pictures of just making sure.

16
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:48,473
Oh yeah.

17
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:48,633
Okay.

18
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:58,142
They, they, they come through in the pictures of the crater, um, the light tone crater ray, um, kind of over top of that.

19
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:01,365
of that dark mare, so I'm glad that that comes through.

20
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:12,055
I will focus on the mare in the center and the ring structures.

21
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:13,957
Okay, yeah.

22
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,180
I will focus on that right now.

23
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:25,969
It's interesting that it seems like that mare in the center is actually to the right, but it is true now that I'm

24
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:36,187
of looking at my naked eye and know that in the topography that mare is not the right but it's actually in the center.

25
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm going to take a few more pictures focusing on that ring to the north because it's actually not that obvious.

26
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,105
I was expecting that topography to stand out a little bit more

27
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,410
But it doesn't.

28
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:59,500
So I've taken a few photos focused on the center but also did a few around the edges of that crater.

29
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:18,906
So as I'm just continuing to zoom in and I focus on that center mare, there's definitely

30
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:25,923
like a another ring that's to the to the right of the center more.

31
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:32,354
And I think that, yeah, that shows up in the LTP topography as well.

32
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,029
Let's see texture wise.

33
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,356
The base of this crater looks quite smooth.

34
00:03:50,617 --> 00:04:01,788
Oppenheyer next to it looks more rough.

35
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:05,571
So I would say Apollo Basin is the smoother one.

36
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:14,880
And again, the mare has very sharp boundaries that are not diffuse.

37
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:22,769
Let's say I got a little distracted by the beauty that is Apollo Basin.

38
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:25,793
So let me double check.

39
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,536
I think I'm right on time.

40
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,263
Oh, all right, I'll keep recording for a second.

41
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,327
All right, Kelsey, you want this camera?

42
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,852
Here, switch SD card.

43
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:45,576
All right, let me give you my SD card.

44
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:53,789
And this way, I can actually record what SD card I have, which is SD card 1026.

45
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,610
Slot 1.

46
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:55,592
Huh?

47
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:58,255
Nope.

48
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:05,245
I don't know if it matters.

49
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:07,848
All right.

50
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:13,816
I don't know what to do with this, but this seems important.

51
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:14,297
Oi, oi.

52
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,790
Could you put that in the Ziploc?

53
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,594
Now I guess I'll pause my recording.

54
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,876
Oh, do you need to be in this window?

55
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,479
I sure do.

56
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,700
Window two.

57
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:26,882
She's a beauty.

58
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:29,225
She is a beauty.

59
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:38,496
I've found that putting your feet on here helps stabilize the shifting of the chair.
