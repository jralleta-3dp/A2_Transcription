1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:05,902
Angela here.

2
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:14,991
OK, I am back with you and I see my next target is 14 Oppenheimer Basin.

3
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:22,740
It's a high priority, so let me get great image coverage of it because I have the camera at the moment.

4
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:29,246
Right, I'm gonna.

5
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:32,670
Look at.

6
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,073
Apollo.

7
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:49,491
And then I'm going to zoom in and make sure that I can get Alpenheuer, which is right next to Apollo.

8
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:56,981
Yep, just double checking my LTP that it is the cluster of three.

9
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:04,210
Well, actually, what's obvious to me is that it kind of looks like three Mari patches within this

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,042
within this greater crater.

11
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:25,152
So I'll just make sure I get focus on some of the low points and the higher points so hopefully you can get that good mosaic of it.

12
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:34,062
I will make sure to get Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin in one single frame.

13
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:40,951
I just saw that target.

14
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:44,036
Yeah, let me try to compare these two.

15
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:57,294
There's a lot more diffuse boundaries in the Oppenheimer Basin Mare patches than the Apollo Mare patches.

16
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,357
They're much more distinct and sharp.

17
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,649
in Apollo versus Oppenheimer Basin, which is, again, that diffuse type of boundary.

18
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:09,754
I'm also here.

19
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,381
If I get at a better angle, maybe I can see this.

20
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:18,527
So now I'm kind of clocked a little bit.

21
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:23,610
differently, so if you see that change in angle, that's why.

22
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:34,883
I'm just trying to focus on the crater ray that's coming from Crook's that's separating these two craters.

23
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:49,358
Let me zoom out a little bit just to make sure I get Crook's in the photo, but then I will just like kind of slowly zoom in and then I'm at my max zoom now focusing on that.

24
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:57,445
crater ray, which is almost at the boundary of Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin.

25
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:19,733
In general, for the color tones and differences between Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo Basin, I would say Oppenheimer Basin has darker, deeper tones than Apollo.

26
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:33,885
The deepest of the tones is of the three kind of dark patches that are within Oppenheimer Basin.

27
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:45,838
The top one is the darkest.

28
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:58,232
Let me just make sure I'm on timeline still.

29
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,815
Okay, I am.

30
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:12,518
Okay, I'm gonna leave it there and take a few more pictures.
