1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:08,844
All right, starting target eight, the Mari, Injani, and Swirls, the first observation of it.

2
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:16,071
I'll spend a few minutes before, a few seconds at least, before I got on the voice recorder to make sure I've located it.

3
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:27,642
It's more tucked in towards the Terminator, at least the West Terminator than I was expecting compared to the LTP.

4
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:36,195
image indexing off Apollo, able to make my way across Labintz and then pick up where Mari Ingeni and swirls are.

5
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:52,640
But given the illumination conditions right now, can maybe see just a little bit of the lighter tone swirls at the bottom of Mari Ingeni, but it is at the extreme of the Terminator.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,705
So picking up that albedo is a little difficult.

7
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:02,595
What I do see there is a lot of the topography, so I do see the rim of Mare Injani.

8
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:07,481
Looks like a very mountainous region, especially to the east of it.

9
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:25,422
Concentrating a little bit more on the texture, I see a lot of texture also trending northeast from there towards some of that crater complex that is up from Mare Injani.

10
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:34,892
And it definitely is unique in that area for some of that texture between Lubinsk and Mari-Injanai.

11
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:46,424
One quick note, picking up at Lubinsk, there's a very, very bright spot kind of at the seven to eight o'clock of Lubinsk, a very bright spot.

12
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:51,730
It's pretty small, but again, seven to eight,

13
00:01:52,537 --> 00:02:03,688
a clock from Lubinsk that's only right near the crater rim, not too far from the crater rim of Lubinsk.

14
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,272
Back to Mare Ingenii, so the albedo, just a few more words on that.

15
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:18,443
Like I said, the swirls at the bottom of Mare Ingenii are possibly being picked up right now with the naked eye, but it's a little challenging.

16
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:28,463
given its location, hopefully as the moon rotates or as we pass by the moon, we'll start to pick up that a little bit more direct on.

17
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:34,889
And so hopefully the second observation of Mare Ingenii will be able to pick that up a little bit better, or hopefully the camera will.

18
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,092
The rest of Mare Ingenii is pretty dark.

19
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:48,463
The Mare patches at the bottom are definitely some of the darkest down in that area as you track over from

20
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:49,324
from Apollo.

21
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:55,249
It's kind of at the same color as that dark patch at the bottom of Apollo.

22
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:13,864
And so just for a comparison between the two, between Apollo, Mare Ingenii, and Labintz, I would still classify Apollo as the darkest, Mare Ingenii pretty close to Apollo, and Labintz, the darker patches, as a little bit lighter of the three.

23
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,248
A few more words on Mare Ingenii.

24
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:33,700
Just a really spectacular area down there that as I stare out at the moon a little bit without looking down at the PCD, my eye starts to pick up those subtleties that you start to see in the topography.

25
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:42,030
Overall, one of the things that I'm really interested in is about that bright spot right off of Lubinsk at the 7 to 8 o'clock.

26
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:46,075
So hopefully follow up with you guys on that during the debrief.

27
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:54,327
So I'm going to end target number eight, Mari Injani in Swirls here, and I get that recording saved out for you.
