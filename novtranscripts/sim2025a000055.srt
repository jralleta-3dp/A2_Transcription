1
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:04,501
All right, back with you on target 22.

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:11,848
Now back over into the window number two with the camera and the long lens.

3
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,793
And so just taking a look now and getting set up, but I'm gonna leave the audio on.

4
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:20,937
So forget a few little ramblings here as I get set up on target 22.

5
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:29,806
So I'm looking for that crater region and luckily have the long lens to help me get there.

6
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:32,569
So gonna,

7
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:36,650
index off of Jackson.

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,415
Make sure that it's about in line with the southern part of Muscovian Basin.

9
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:51,004
Again, forgive my rambling here as I make sure that I'm getting the right target and the right focal length.

10
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:57,190
So it looks like you want highest focal length surrounding dark plains and central images of the region.

11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,775
So I'm gonna make sure that I've got the right

12
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:31,564
Target, I think I've got the right target because I See a distinct darker region in that that I can pick up off the 200 milliliter 200 millimeter image in the lunar targeting package, so gonna go ahead and start with a Center image and work my way in with that focal length all the way to the highest so first image and

13
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:40,931
is gonna capture both Jackson and Muscovian basins and work my way into what I believe that crater is.

14
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:46,656
And I can really start to pick up that darker region.

15
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:52,361
Really appreciate the camera now after trying to view some things with the naked eye.

16
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:59,408
And so I'm gonna do that whole sequence of images again, working my way in.

17
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:14,993
with the camera slowly changing the zoom lens but keeping the central focus spot in the same area.

18
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:23,462
This looks like it's, just double checking where my next highest priority target is, Muscovian Basin, so looks like I'm good, so I'm gonna take a few more shots.

19
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:29,108
Trying to keep at the highest

20
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:39,061
focal length and kind of surround that area with a number of images.

21
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:48,675
Changing a little bit the camera orientation relative to the window of Orion to just make sure I get some glare out of there.

22
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:54,083
And double checking my shroud to make sure I don't have any light seeping in.

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:10,622
Capturing a few good images of that area, the target 22 area with Jackson also in frame.

24
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:16,390
It allows you to trace from Jackson to that area via some of the rays.

25
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:31,731
And one last image zoomed out to capture both the Earth and Moon as it currently

26
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:39,431
is oriented out window two and I'm just going to do another series with the camera oriented in vertical.

27
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:56,977
It's a little bit harder to stabilize the camera in vertical but does give you a little bit more north-south extent.

28
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,325
Man, Earth is beautiful out there so I'm just going to take a picture of

29
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,425
a few pictures of Earth while we have the opportunity.

30
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:30,433
Okay, a few bonus pictures of Earth there at the end, but I'm gonna close out.

31
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:32,616
Target 22.

32
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,097
and move on to Jackson.
