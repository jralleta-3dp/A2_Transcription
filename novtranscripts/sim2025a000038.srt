1
00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:03,276
Okay, so now I had finished.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,982
I am starting number 25, Jewel's Fern.

3
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:23,187
So I'm looking for Jewel's Fern over between Tioskovsky and to the west of Mari Injani.

4
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,049
So I can definitely see this.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,114
This is the one with the C-shaped Mari patch.

6
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:32,739
in the center of it just west of Mare Injani.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:44,237
And so I'm about, let's see, about 200, 250 kilometers from the Terminator on the left.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,104
That's where I am too.

9
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:54,372
And so I can definitely see that.

10
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:03,671
And so I can tell there.

11
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:09,259
And so what I really want to do is sort of look for any history of fractures.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,307
And so they have potentially some four fractured critters in here.

13
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:18,853
I can't really see any of these fractures.

14
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:27,586
I can tell from my LTP, they're sort of along the edge of that C. But from this view right here, I can't resolve those.

15
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,527
Really, it's the

16
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:33,506
the dark mare patches that are much easier to see.

17
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:41,973
That C shape looks so much more distinct right now than it actually does in my...

18
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:58,868
I can sort of see some of those raised rims in there, but as we're getting closer, the small craters that are around Jules Verne are becoming much more defined with their limbs, their rims,

19
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:04,303
It's definitely sort of, you can see the morphology starting to come back.

20
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:08,709
The Jules Verne crater is circular, is mostly circular in shape.

21
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:19,364
The mare sort of has that sharper boundary, especially on the bottom, the bottom part of the outside of the sea.

22
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:21,126
But as you go up towards the top,

23
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:32,728
especially right where that crater is, like around the 11 o'clock and the boundary of the Jules Verne, you really start to lose that distinct boundary of that mare patch.

24
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:42,176
The gray inside is sort of the lighter, is a bit of a lighter gray up top and that darker gray the bottom.

25
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:50,944
That two-tone is very similar to what I can see on Muscovy and say with that lighter tone on the bottom and that darker tone on top.

26
00:02:53,017 --> 00:03:19,817
the the shadows are starting to show up especially there's that brighter spot just north of like about the 10 30 position um and so i can start to see that that part oh this part of the moon's falling down um and start to see that bright area along the top very high

27
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:27,506
Bright albedo and so you can start to see that a little bit of that Rim brightness.

28
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:50,293
I really can't pull out too much of the texture that is in there from this perspective But it is Just Is my timeline

29
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,438
Looks like I actually was a little bit ahead.

30
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:57,379
That's okay.

31
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,123
I'm still looking at the Jules Verne right there.

32
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:07,969
Um, and one of the things it's like those sort of brighter areas as you go around.

33
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:11,513
Do you see one like to the north?

34
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,735
You definitely see it.

35
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:19,180
If I go to my OneNote here for my Jules Verne.

36
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,922
Oh, made a line.

37
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:24,545
I see the like one bright zone.

38
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,889
I'm going to draw it in here on my page.

39
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:36,604
I see the one bright zone below, but the area that's a little bit brighter above it doesn't really show up as much in my LTP.

40
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,588
And so it's like just around these two craters.

41
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:41,671
I've sort of highlighted them.

42
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:45,998
It looks like a little beret on top of my crater right now.

43
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,298
Um, and so I can see where that brightness is.

44
00:04:49,378 --> 00:05:01,809
It's almost like I can follow that brightness around sort of like, you know, when you sweat and like the saltiness sort of makes the sweat stains that stay on like your workout clothes or like a swimsuit.

45
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,353
That is sort of how like sort of these bright patches look.

46
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:13,420
They're like very granular, um, sort of raising up a little bit, but very delicate on top.

47
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:26,638
um sort of these white braids almost look like white veins going around um the moon.

48
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:40,572
Um let's see it's really hard to see any slopes in there and um I think that's pretty good for my jewel's fern.

49
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:46,191
Just really neat looking at the moon this way after like looking at it so close up with my camera.

50
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:54,678
So taking this step back again and looking at it from a distance and comparing the areas to each other in one full swoop.

51
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,781
This really is a really neat view to be able to see.

52
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:06,069
Especially like looking over and like as South Polacan Basin is sort of disappearing off the limb.

53
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:10,913
That's sort of like the yellowish tint that's like around

54
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:12,918
Apollo Basin.

55
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,221
It's sort of like a very light yellow.

56
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:24,432
That's really neat to sort of see that bit of color over there against the stark grayness that is along the Terminator.

57
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:39,769
That I'm pretty, pretty impressed with as I start to go through and look at these and watching Jackson and these really high albedo rays start to disappear as well.

58
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:50,603
It's pretty incredible to have gone from when we first started looking at this we had that full disc and now we're just looking at a section of the moon and it's pretty neat.
