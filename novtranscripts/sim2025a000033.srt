1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:28,722
starting my Whole Moon target so this is our last Whole Moon looking at Whole Moon and SPA basin I'm gonna work on doing a mosaic here and so I'm gonna do north to south snake pattern starting at the disappearing limb at a mid a

2
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:57,713
mid focal length so I'm gonna go at about 200 here it's gonna be my starting point so I'm gonna start right over at the limb uh near the north pole that's disappearing so I'm just gonna start my mosaic here just looking at all the the rays I can still see um and Jackson and Crookes Crater on my way down here all the way down to Apollo Basin as I go across I can see that

3
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:03,735
Ray from Jackson's still really well in the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin area.

4
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:07,901
I guess I'll try this methodology also.

5
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,104
Oh, I moved.

6
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:11,105
That was dumb.

7
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,709
I'm gonna restart my mosaic.

8
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,734
Gonna start again from the top.

9
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:22,042
Because I moved mid-thing, so I wanted to make sure that you all can make this mosaic much better.

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,966
So I'm gonna work on going through this again.

11
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,225
Now back down to Apollo Basin.

12
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:34,414
Going over, I can still see Apollo Basin as I work my way up.

13
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:41,123
Still see the limb sort of on the, still within my frame here.

14
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,790
Back up to the top.

15
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,393
go work my way down.

16
00:01:48,573 --> 00:02:00,170
I'm really starting to see how these rays are over going the terrain behind it and also how a lot of these craters they don't look as sharp as I would have thought.

17
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:15,692
So as I get closer to the Terminator that I am those morphologies is becoming much more

18
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:20,901
Defined and just looking in all these different Mari patches.

19
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:44,818
You see some of those wider streets especially between my engine I and looking up at Muscovy and I'm right in the middle of the NC working my way back down snaking around Tioskovsky with that big Mari pond Mari and I you can finally start to see those swirls better than I could see them in the first I

20
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:55,592
First time around and then working my way back up.

21
00:02:55,812 --> 00:03:06,347
Hang on, come right back down on the Terminator.

22
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,591
Get a little bit of Earth in my view.

23
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:25,146
Alright, I finished that whole mosaic going through, so I'm actually pretty excited about that.

24
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:34,277
I did, like I said before, I did restart it, but did pull it through, sort of seeing that transition between the different areas that I looked at.

25
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,164
Yaskowski right there on that rim.

26
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,273
Really incredible to be looking at the moon like that.
