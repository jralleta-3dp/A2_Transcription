1
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:02,594
Getting ready for Earthrise.

2
00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:03,975
I'm watching for it.

3
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:08,220
I think I know where it should be coming from, but I'm not sure.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,543
So I'm just gonna keep looking right over the edge here.

5
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:15,548
I'm just sort of waiting to see.

6
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:22,295
Make sure that I can just keep imaging until hopefully that I can see it appear.

7
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:29,683
It should be coming pretty soon here.

8
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:31,938
Uh, maybe not right away.

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:39,124
Um... Earthrise, yeah, it's now inside the Earthrise target.

10
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,766
And so there it is, I can see it coming.

11
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:42,807
There.

12
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:44,969
Oh, it's beautiful.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:53,657
I'm making sure that my focus is on the actual illuminated moon so that way I can get a good moon focus photo.

14
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:56,320
Oh my goodness, hello friends.

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,962
This is so neat.

16
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:04,703
I can start to see the browns coming up and a little bit of the white.

17
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,967
Definitely those blues of the ocean coming up.

18
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:12,032
You can really see looking at the limb of the Earth.

19
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,839
Looking at the limb of the moon, it's very sharp.

20
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,881
I don't really see any fuzziness there.

21
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:23,948
So it's really just bisecting the Earth as it rises.

22
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,591
Oh, here's some white that's coming up.

23
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:28,594
I can now start to see

24
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:32,028
A little bit of Africa is coming.

25
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:32,990
Is that Africa?

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,556
Nope, actually it's Australia.

27
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,300
Good to see you all on the other side.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,407
I can now see the white of Antarctica.

29
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:47,634
Let me start to zoom out and try to get that width.

30
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,240
Oh, that's beautiful.

31
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:59,990
Oh my goodness, I think it's just, this is just one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed in my life.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:08,101
Just here we are waiting for you all to return and just seeing our perfect little neighbor out there.

33
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:12,046
I've seen it from, just absolutely incredible.

34
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:19,236
We've looked back at the Earth a lot on this trip, but nothing like seeing it come out of the darkness on the other side of the moon.

35
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,504
I'm gonna readjust my Pelotour real quick.

36
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,730
Try to get back and get some more photos.

37
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,855
Every little bit helps, right?

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:56,462
The one thing, so like I can, to really tell you what I'm seeing here, I can see about the, it's coming out about the 930 position to the left of the moon, on the west side of the moon.

39
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:05,355
I can see Antarctica, Australia, a little bit of Asia over there, definitely some clouds in the cloud system.

40
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:12,163
Now that I can see the orange of Australia, that's really combining into some of the browns.

41
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,847
Let me try to get that all in one photo.

42
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:25,099
The browns in Australia are sort of bringing out some of the browns that I see in the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin, like definitely around like

43
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:30,648
Mare Anjanai and over from Apollo, sort of those browns are coming out.

44
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:34,293
The blues definitely up with Muscoviense.

45
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:38,698
Those blues sort of help match what we're seeing up there.

46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,264
Absolutely incredible to see it.

47
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:52,015
It looks like the Earth could just fit so perfectly inside the Mare patch from Muscoviense and just absolutely incredible day.

48
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,158
Oh, I'm so happy to

49
00:03:55,505 --> 00:04:17,665
see you all on the other side just a beautiful planet we have here and so contrasting after just looking at the as it was put from um apollo 11 the beautiful desolation of the moon is really in contrast with that beautiful dynamics of the Earth

50
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:30,169
I'm going to make sure I get a mosaic of this Terminator too.

51
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:30,931
Oh, I got it.

52
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,460
So I'm going to start with the from north to south.

53
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:43,015
I got my Terminator at the edge of my screen.

54
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,263
Let's see on my 50% overlap.

55
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,422
Now going a little bit closer to that limb.

56
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:03,045
Going right back up.

57
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:06,670
Trying to make sure I get some focus on me.

58
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,753
Get the focus spots.

59
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,038
Absolutely stunning.
