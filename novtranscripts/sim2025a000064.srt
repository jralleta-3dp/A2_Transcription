1
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:06,590
All right, I'm starting Sudman Crater, target number seven.

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,677
Taking a look now for locating it on the limb just above Oriental.

3
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:17,264
This one's definitely at the extent of the human eye.

4
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:28,840
I can't for say, using the LDP, flipping back and forth, that I for sure am seeing Sudman, target number seven.

5
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:43,361
There is a few white specks out there above Apollo Basin that I can try to index off of, but really hard to pick up Sudman for sure.

6
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,164
So let me just try to index again.

7
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,726
I see the Apollo ring.

8
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:57,274
I'm just not 100% sure as I zoom in on the LDP and flip my eyes back and forth.

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,064
Um, that I am indeed being able to pick up Sundman J Crater.

10
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:10,433
So, um, hopefully Marie's picking that up in the camera, um, at the highest focal length that she can.

11
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:18,561
Uh, there is a lot of albedo little specks of white and kind of a medium gray field out there.

12
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:24,107
Not a lot of topography is picking up in these illumination conditions, except for that rim of Apollo.

13
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:27,430
Um, and.

14
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:29,957
I'm sorry, Oriental.

15
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:33,301
So every time I said Apollo previously, it's Orientale Basin.

16
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:45,119
So just right above Orientale Basin, just that field of speckled white in that medium gray and just not able to pick out Sudman for sure.

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,568
The rays of one of the crater in there maybe are a little distinct.

18
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,773
So, but I don't think it's Sudman.

19
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:58,378
I think it's more towards Ohms Crater and

20
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:05,550
Yeah, with that I'm going to close out target number 7 and move to 8 just because I'm not 100% sure that I'm seeing Sudman.
