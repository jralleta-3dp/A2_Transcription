1
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:08,698
All right, starting number target two, the limb out at Ocea procularis.

2
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:23,693
So gonna try to cover this in a series of photos at the highest focal length right along that limb.

3
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:27,237
So that's about where I left off on target one.

4
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,455
The highest focal length, trying to make sure the target's sharp.

5
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:40,361
As I work down, trying to get almost 75% overlap.

6
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:58,759
I'm also gonna give that more of a context by zooming out, targeting the center of target two.

7
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:10,472
And do that again with another series of images at about 75% overlap.

8
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:23,170
Definitely can see the darker parts of that target.

9
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:29,940
All right, on the limb, don't noticeably see a lot of topography picking up just based on the illumination right now.

10
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,146
Through the highest zoom of the lens,

11
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:40,841
Definitely see a lot of albedo change across the transition.

12
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:50,031
Take a few just centered in right on the limb, kind of pressing the extremes of the camera focus.

13
00:01:54,737 --> 00:02:02,766
And again, gonna take a fully zoomed out but centered image

14
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,589
on that target and just work inwards.

15
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,618
He's in the same center spot, but just changing the zoom.

16
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,397
Okay, quick look at the observation actions.

17
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:27,441
I covered a lot of the focus changes that I was making.

18
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,128
The color is pretty stark in that area, goes from the dark

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:53,461
black of the part of the target that is centered on the target image seen in the LTP, and then has a pretty stark transition from that dark area into the lighter albedo areas, kind of towards Ohm Crater Crater as you make your way out that way.

20
00:02:55,463 --> 00:03:01,930
I could pick it up, the resolution of Marius Hills, but not as much topography as I thought I would see along the

21
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,455
that complex rim.

22
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:09,675
I'm going to end voice recording here and move on to target three.
