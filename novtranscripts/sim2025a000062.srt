1
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:06,298
All right, starting target 23 with the camera and Jackson.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,872
Captured a lot of Jackson when I was taking photos of the target 22 crater region area.

3
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:26,848
So I'm a little behind on the timeline with Jackson, but I think I'll make it up here just knowing that I captured a lot of Jackson in that last crater or that last camera sequence.

4
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:30,647
Gonna double check to make sure I get everything that you want.

5
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:38,698
So you want photographs of the center of the entire ray system at the highest focal length and multiple overlapping images as needed.

6
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,243
So I'm gonna go ahead and make some observations of Jackson when I do that.

7
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:52,296
But again, look at all the images that I took of target 21, or sorry, target 22,

8
00:00:53,018 --> 00:01:00,291
because there's a lot of great photos of Jackson in there based on some of that image.

9
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:08,064
Specifically going to try to target on some of the rays of Jackson with the highest imaging.

10
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:15,617
So I'm going to take, I've got a series of images that zoomed in on Jackson from lowest to highest zoom.

11
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:31,857
and I'm gonna take from the highest of zoom and work out some of the ray systems to the south and north of Jackson to the furthest extent that I can view them, which is a long, long way.

12
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:42,567
So I just took a series of six photos to the south, starting at the center of Jackson and going south.

13
00:01:45,162 --> 00:02:04,406
at the highest resolution, did the same, a series of three going to the north, and then a series of five going to that ray that is headed towards Muscovian's Basin.

14
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:12,216
And last thing I'm gonna do here with Jackson is capture it in a context photo.

15
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,718
I've got a couple of these now,

16
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:21,493
Make sure that I capture the whole upper northern two-thirds of the moon.

17
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:30,109
And an image that is well-centered and frames all of Jackson Rays and includes Muscovian's Basin.

18
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,838
Gonna take a few in a couple different orientations with the camera.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,625
Captures the whole eastern limb.

20
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,241
and close out Jackson.

21
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:57,869
Man, it's a really unique crater that the camera allows you to see some of the grade system like your naked eye does not pick up.

22
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:13,067
The albedo doesn't seem to change as you get away from that central crater, but the central crater is a high albedo, definitely distinct and really dramatic through the camera lens.

23
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:20,712
And with that, I will close out target 23 Jackson Crater and it looks like moving on to Jules Verne next.
