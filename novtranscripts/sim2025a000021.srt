1
00:00:02,444 --> 00:00:08,814
All right, this is Angela and I am starting target 10, two of three, which is the Whole Moon.

2
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:15,764
I have the camera and so I'm going to start my north to south sneak pattern.

3
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:21,974
Mosaic was 50% image overlap.

4
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:31,168
I switched the camera to my SD card, which I can't remember the Name, number of it, but I'm sure it's written somewhere.

5
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,501
Okay.

6
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,946
And you want me to be at mid focal length.

7
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,411
So standby.

8
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:44,672
All right.

9
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:50,901
I'm around, uh, I'm just going to go up to 300.

10
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:56,770
Uh, no, 200 seems to be perfectly adequate.

11
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:57,471
All right.

12
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:03,720
Starting from the north and starting my snake now.

13
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:31,499
Yeah, I'm sitting upright at the moment, so the north to south snake should look pretty straight.

14
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:38,550
So as I'm snaking, I can really tell

15
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:49,351
the stark differences in albedo between the rays.

16
00:01:49,371 --> 00:02:06,746
I think of Jackson and of Crooks overlapping kind of the mar beneath.

17
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:08,908
It's really quite stunning.

18
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,240
Alright, so, kind of just snaked over Apollo's basin.

19
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,831
And now I'm right about around Crook's.

20
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,398
Passing over Jackson.

21
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:38,153
It's really difficult to keep the camera

22
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:43,639
steady.

23
00:02:43,699 --> 00:03:02,352
My body is very tense so I can keep it still and get that 50% overlap that you guys are looking for.

24
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:32,921
I'm on my last snake now.

25
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:48,184
I realize I probably made some pretty tightly packed together snakes, but I think you'd enjoy that.

26
00:03:52,349 --> 00:04:14,678
Okay, now I'm just gonna kind of look through my camera and give you some general impressions, which is, wow, yeah, the morphology on the Terminator is just really, stands out a lot more in my zoomed camera.

27
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,500
General impressions, it's just

28
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:22,064
that some of these colors are really subtle.

29
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:43,592
There's a little bit of like an orange tone that I'm seeing like orangish red in Muscovy Ents that's standing out.

30
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,015
Same with the

31
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,158
same in Apollo Basin.

32
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:56,389
But yeah, I think the thing that kind of dominates the landscape right now is just the craters of Jackson.

33
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:09,946
They have just, they reach not quite Moskowience to the west.

34
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,930
They reach

35
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:44,301
definitely up until crooks and they're just big and bright and beautiful I'm sure there'll be more to come oh I see Earth let me yeah as I'm as I'm still on this Whole Moon I almost almost missed it

36
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:54,225
but for the first time I can see Earth and I'm gonna take some shots of it even though it's not in our plan.

37
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,553
It's just so beautiful.

38
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:05,943
Hey, it's nice to see you all the way over there.

39
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:10,930
And those are pictures of the screen and not the poster board.

40
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:15,874
Alright, I'll end it there and pick up at Bavilov.
