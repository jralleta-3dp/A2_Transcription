1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,174
All right, I'm still in window two.

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:19,192
I'm using the camera to look for Impact Flashes, but while I do that, I'm gonna capture a full frame of the moon when this dramatic, like, half-Terminator thing creeping across the moon.

3
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:25,381
I'm gonna use the camera to keep an eye out for Impact Flashes.

4
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:29,567
Whoop, I just saw something in a wiggly line through the camera.

5
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:32,451
I wasn't holding down the,

6
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:40,846
the shutter at the time, but I saw a squiggly green line fly across the Terminator of the moon.

7
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:49,098
It definitely wasn't a point function, but it was a, maybe I saw kind of a streak, possible impact flash.

8
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,660
If it was, it was bright green.

9
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:56,488
It was in the northern third of the dark Terminator area.

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,877
Trying to take some pictures there, but I'll try to go ahead and annotate what I saw.

11
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:10,091
after taking a few more photos and then I'll get back to making observations.

12
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:24,747
So look out for a one note annotation from my observations of a green impact possible flash in the early parts of observing the target 27.
