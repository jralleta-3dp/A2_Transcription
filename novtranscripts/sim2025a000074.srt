1
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:07,794
All right, starting high priority target number 26, Muscovians Basin.

2
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:14,643
Specifically going to center some images and capture that entire basin.

3
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:16,846
Might make it a few little mosaics of it.

4
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,952
It's really starting to pop now as it comes closer to the Terminator.

5
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:24,697
So this is great lighting conditions to capture it.

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:33,109
Definitely can give you guys some words on the structure, texture, and variations of any color and albedo.

7
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:37,406
And I'm going to keep a close eye out for lava flows.

8
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,269
The basin rim right now is really starting to pop.

9
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,433
So hopefully those come across in the images and any swirls.

10
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:49,999
So lots to look at for, lots to look out for in Muscovian basin.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,446
And I'll double check that I've captured any notes after I start shooting some pictures here.

12
00:00:56,486 --> 00:01:02,472
So I might go quiet for a little bit as I capture some Muscovians.

13
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:04,899
glamour shots here.

14
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:27,293
Okay, at the highest resolution, so at 400, I can capture all of Muscovian's ring structure with a little bit of the Terminator in there.

15
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:31,800
And so I'm gonna capture a couple photos

16
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:52,432
a couple 20 or so in different orientations, different things in the frame of the photo for context.

17
00:01:52,572 --> 00:02:01,804
So a couple with the limb in there or with the Terminator, sorry, in there and a couple with the limb in there.

18
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,897
Again, all at 400 millimeters.

19
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,062
Now I'm gonna do a quick little mosaic.

20
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,590
About 75% overlap.

21
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,648
Realizing I'm doing an east-west snake.

22
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,526
Probably should have done a north-south one given the Terminator conditions right now, but shouldn't matter too much.

23
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:49,160
Okay, so there's a mosaic in there at 400 millimeter, that east-west snake across Muscovians, a tier of three from north to south.

24
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:59,972
Again, using the camera lens kind of as a binocular now, or a monocular,

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:13,894
I can maybe see some really nice terminations of the mare, you know, the lava coming up against some of the rim structure to the west side of Muscovians.

26
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:21,321
Specifically, starting around the one o'clock to four o'clock.

27
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,264
Seems like it comes the closest to the rim there.

28
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:29,790
Take a few more photos.

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:48,383
Really concentrating on trying to keep the camera steady, take out any shakes and not cram the camera too much into the window while I'm doing this.

30
00:03:52,068 --> 00:04:02,702
Albedo wise, the highest albedo is right at the crater rim at the, I'll say 1030.

31
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:07,708
Between 10 and 11 o'clock is the highest albedo on the crater rim.

32
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:14,825
The darkest albedo is at the base of the crater about one o'clock.

33
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:25,015
There's a crater down there that's at two o'clock that's right around there seems to be the darkest part of that mare patch.

34
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:28,719
Everything else is a couple of tones of gray in between.

35
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:36,987
Didn't see any distinct colors other than shades of gray at this time.

36
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:42,299
I'm taking a quick look at the LTP and allow my eyes to adjust back inside of the cabinet.

37
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:56,239
So I definitely got a good centered images, captured the entire basin, captured the basin with some different things in context, and also a small little mosaic there.

38
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:04,071
I'm not going to make any annotation here because I didn't see any

39
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,338
strong color difference and I hopefully described the albedo context best I could.

40
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,433
But I want to keep my hands on the camera here and get on to the next image and close out strong.

41
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:20,541
So that's it for target number 26.
