1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,093
Alright, Kelsey back with you here.

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:09,527
I have now swapped windows with Angela and now I have the camera.

3
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:13,115
I have put my SD card, my own SD card into the camera.

4
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:17,304
I forgot to look at the number of that so I'll report that at the end of my shift here.

5
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:20,571
And I'm moving on to my next target which is a

6
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,076
high priority target.

7
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:27,763
It's the South Polar region, which is of course super exciting for future surface missions.

8
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:32,649
And I'll just take a minute to kind of get oriented with what I'm seeing here.

9
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:39,057
Let me just go ahead and zoom in.

10
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:39,618
Oh, wow.

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,981
Having the camera is such a different view.

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,723
It's gorgeous.

13
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,568
Okay, I've got some pictures here and zooming in.

14
00:00:49,588 --> 00:01:07,483
I see the South Poleaitken Basin-Aitken Crater Basin with that, I don't know, it really kind of looks right now in my view almost smoother than, it does look a bit smoother than the rest of the moon, which is interesting because I know it's much older.

15
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:28,211
Let me see, I'm zooming in on the targets I just described before I had the camera, Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo, and all those mare patches pop out even more now, making me think that the descriptions I gave to you of those targets were not nearly as useful as the descriptions looking through this viewfinder here.

16
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:36,002
Those albedo differences pop out so much better, and I can even start to see some of the topography that I was lacking with the naked eye view.

17
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:44,805
I know my near-term focus is on Oppenheimer Basin and Apollo because I just described it, but I'll expand my focus.

18
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:47,629
Let's see what I'm supposed to be looking for on the LTP here.

19
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,698
Topography along the lunar horizon and illuminated rim of Schrodinger.

20
00:01:54,699 --> 00:02:00,488
Oh gosh, it's hard to see Schrodinger.

21
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:04,180
Yeah, it's really hard to pick out Schrodinger.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,384
I don't really think I can see it in this view.

23
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:12,512
But I will take a look at the topography along the horizon.

24
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,313
Let me see here.

25
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:19,863
Yeah, I'm starting to see more topography pop out, certainly along that horizon.

26
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:23,227
Again, the crater rims stand out so beautifully.

27
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,210
I'm going to zoom in here and take a picture.

28
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:36,411
And I'm just seeing dark mare patches, both circular and less circular in nature, pop out across the South Polar region.

29
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:43,303
I'm going to take a few pictures highlighting the diversity of the mare patches that I see in the South Polar region.

30
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:50,775
Those images just captured some bright white, very tiny, high, high, high albedo

31
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:58,395
features that might indicate that they're young, fresh impact craters, which is, I know, of interest to the science team.

32
00:02:58,895 --> 00:02:59,556
Oh, look right here.

33
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:06,825
That image I just took, I think, captured a crater that has significant diversity of mare in it.

34
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:12,873
There's that beautiful Albedo ray from Crooks coming down in the middle of Apollo and Oppenheimer Basin.

35
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:16,257
I'll zoom in on the sort of extent of it down to the bottom.

36
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,581
Let me see what else I'm supposed to be.

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,810
I'm supposed to be taking a mosaic of the entire illuminated region, north-south snake pattern.

38
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:31,976
All right, and that looks like my...

39
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,139
I'll take a minute and just get oriented.

40
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:43,373
It's such a better view with this viewfinder.

41
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,516
You can pick out so much more detail.

42
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,243
I'm looking at it through the viewfinder.

43
00:03:52,079 --> 00:04:02,191
Alright, so now I'm going to take my mosaic.

44
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:04,814
Let's see, I'm going to start here.

45
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:10,701
And 50% overlap north-south.

46
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,112
Still taking my mosaic here.

47
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:38,970
Okay, I'm probably taking way more images here than is warranted, but hey, it's the South Poleaitken Basin, it's exciting stuff.

48
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:47,668
All right, so I'm gonna go in, I think this is my last picture of this, so I'm gonna go in and add the WAV file, but I'll go ahead and stop the recording.
