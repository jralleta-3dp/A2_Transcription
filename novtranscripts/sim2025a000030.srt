1
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:04,690
Alright, it is Marie.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,912
I just got back into the seat.

3
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:10,977
I'm going to try to look along the exosphere.

4
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:15,301
Just sort of look and see if I can see any light coming up.

5
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:20,447
So I have the camera in window 3 and window 2.

6
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:22,369
The one without the cab cam.

7
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,191
The one where I should be with my camera.

8
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:30,578
So I'm going to start looking along the limbs here.

9
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:33,008
I think Earth is going to be coming from.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,534
Looking to see if I can... oh my camera isn't on.

11
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:39,415
My camera is on.

12
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:43,259
We're still doing a little picture wise.

13
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,781
We got our new card inside.

14
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:58,995
That is card 1029 is in my slot 1.

15
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:26,907
so i can actually now getting organized here so i'm going to be looking along the the rim and the exosphere trying to look and see if i can see any evidence i don't really see too much right now this looks a little bit fuzzy but it's it is hard because we know the Earth will be coming up from behind

16
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:50,633
an area that is in darkness so it's still really hard but if I look at the disappearing limb taking some images as I look at that as well just going up and down oh I could see a little spot of something off in the distance there and that's very interesting a little white spot off of the limb

17
00:01:51,254 --> 00:02:04,727
I'm not really sure what that is but it's sort of like coming over from Jackson, halfway between Jackson, like following that about the 430 ray down.

18
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,493
It goes towards where that little light area is.

19
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,398
So that's the end of my...
