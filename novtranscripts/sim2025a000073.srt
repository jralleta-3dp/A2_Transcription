1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:05,385
Okay, starting target 25 Jules Verne crater.

2
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:08,489
I'm just kind of centered up on that.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,557
Oh, there's a few minute break between 24 and 25.

4
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:20,284
So it looks like I got a little extra time on Jules Verne.

5
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:23,248
So going to go ahead and capture this one right.

6
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:27,894
The LTP has like a five minute break between 23 and 25.

7
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,477
So it seems like we're missing 24.

8
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:36,920
And so hopefully the LTP is right.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,504
I'm going to keep going with 25 with Jules Verne.

10
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:47,795
Give me one second to get right back onto the target list.

11
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:52,642
So looking for centered photographs at the highest focal length of Jules.

12
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:59,492
And I've got pretty good eyes on it, was able to index off of Silkowski pretty easily.

13
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:03,838
And so we're going to go ahead and start shooting some photos.

14
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:14,957
that includes Tsiolkovsky, so you can also index off of it just like I did towards Jules.

15
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:25,172
Overall, Jules is starting to become highlighted by that illumination of the Terminator.

16
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:34,686
Topography is really starting to pop, especially to the north of it at 10 to two o'clock.

17
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:39,098
There's a central little mare patch there.

18
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:53,818
It's like the size of a cashew nut that starts to really stick out, distinct in its albedo.

19
00:01:56,342 --> 00:02:04,032
One of the things that just my eye keeps getting drawn to is that central peak of Silkoski, so trying to capture a few images of that while I can.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,153
just because it's so dramatic on the limb.

21
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:47,812
Just taking a quick look back to make sure that everything's set up for this final little stretch and try not to miss Muscovian base and a high priority target coming up.

22
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:59,871
Really one of the things that stuck out to me on Jules Verne is that distinct topography that's starting to pop in the illumination conditions.

23
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:28,391
I've got plenty of photos that are at the highest resolution or highest zoom of the lens, 400 millimeters.

24
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,817
A couple different orientations to try to capture that topography.

25
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,925
My eye does pick up on the mare patch a little bit better.

26
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:47,273
When I look above the camera, I can see that mare patch, that little cashew nut shape

27
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,762
a little bit better than what I see through the window and through the lens.

28
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:56,611
So just a note there that my eye is actually picking up that distinct color.

29
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:05,363
I'm sure once you stretch these pictures a little bit, they'll be better than what my eye is seeing through the viewfinder.

30
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,649
Okay, I'm gonna call that.

31
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:18,155
good with Jules Verne target number 25 because I know my next high priority is 26 with Muscovian Basins, a high priority target for you guys.

32
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:22,305
So closing out Jules Verne 25 now.
