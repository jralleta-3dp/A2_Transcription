1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,313
start on Ryder Crater.

2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:07,845
I got really distracted during Earthrise and so I'm gonna get going on this one right now.

3
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:17,421
I can see it's down along the southern, the southern limb and the South Poleaitken Basin Acon and so I'm using this again Marie.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:22,470
I'm looking for Ryder with my camera along the southern rim.

5
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,013
I'm looking to see

6
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,625
So it's definitely sort of hard to pick this one out.

7
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:42,754
So I have this high albedo spot that I'm looking for here.

8
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:52,284
I don't have too much time, so it should be, I can see where, Teosca, is that what there?

9
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:58,451
Okay, I can see the peak right next to it there, and I can see their bright spot now.

10
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,552
I found that peak.

11
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:06,704
I found that bright spot, so I'm going to zoom in and get some good images there of that area.

12
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:14,234
Let's see how that, looking at that with the rest of the South Poleaitken Basin Aiken Basin area.

13
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:21,383
And so, yeah, I can see exactly that crater with the peak ring.

14
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:28,392
So I'm really looking to see if I can see that bright spot

15
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,155
The brightness is not standing out as much as I would have expected right now.

16
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,301
So that is sort of surprising.

17
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:41,823
It's not surprising because it's right on the Terminator there.

18
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:44,806
So that brightness didn't really help me find it.

19
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:46,648
More of the morphology did.

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,632
So making sure that I'm in the right spot.

21
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:57,079
There's the two double right above it and then the mare.

22
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,352
So I definitely got some images of that material there.

23
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:04,518
But really cannot see any of those ejector rays.

24
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,184
And looking for...

25
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:14,091
There's definitely... Yeah, it's definitely slightly lighter.

26
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:20,420
But really hard to just pick out much more of that texture of that small area besides like...

27
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,124
Sort of looks like a dome-y material.

28
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:27,370
Sort of raised a little bit.

29
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:30,495
Slightly lighter than the area around it.

30
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,525
Is that a volcano cone right there?

31
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,773
Probably not, but pretty interesting.
