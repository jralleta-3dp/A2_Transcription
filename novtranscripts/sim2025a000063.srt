1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,639
All right, just starting Target 6.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,306
It looks like I'm a little behind on the timeline, so I'll make this one a little bit quicker.

3
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:23,464
And I've definitely zoomed in with my eye, sorry, on Target 6, the Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and Bubba Crater, just south of Apollo Basin.

4
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:32,637
The illumination down there is a little bit darker right now, so it's hard to pick out those two distinct craters that are next to each other.

5
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,589
Actually struggling with that a little bit.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:48,009
I'm just indexing off of a dark patch that looks like to be the dark patch at the bottom of Bo's crater, if that's the one to my left or the west in the image.

7
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:57,265
And that's the only one that I'm really picking up on is that Bo's crater to the left, if Bose And Bhabha Crater Region's to the right.

8
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,248
And so again, just to make sure I'm clear there.

9
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:03,881
So at three o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater in the image in the LDP.

10
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,787
The one at seven o'clock is what I'm calling Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

11
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,314
And it's Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is actually popping out just below Apollo Crater.

12
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:19,285
I don't see Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that distinct as what's captured in the LTP image.

13
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,852
I will say a little bit more words about the color.

14
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:32,516
So just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region Crater, I do see a light patch that I don't see in any of the imagery on our PCDs.

15
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:42,847
So there's a totally distinct little light patch just below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region that is starting to really stick out to my eye as I continue to look out the window.

16
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:47,933
One thing I will note is looking back and forth between the window and the,

17
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:55,082
and the PCD, my eye does take a few minutes or a few seconds to adjust to pick up those subtle differences.

18
00:01:55,963 --> 00:02:11,406
So I've been trying to concentrate by looking out the window, but also make sure that I get the observations and actions in mind before I start the video recording so I can allow my eyes to adjust without looking down at the LTP too often.

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,487
So just again, to focus on the color, albedo, and texture, I think I checked the box there.

20
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:21,611
Texture's really hard to pick out in these illumination conditions.

21
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:32,865
The only interior thing that I see is the bottom of bows, and that's the only reason that it's able to pick that out at all is a little bit of darker patch at the bottom of bows.

22
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:36,729
And the relationship between the two is kind of what I described.

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,773
I'm really having trouble seeing

24
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:46,865
above a crater compared to Bose And Bhabha Crater Region and just really interested in that little white patch that's below Bose And Bhabha Crater Region.

25
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:49,169
But nothing else really to add there.

26
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,535
Kind of hard in this illumination conditions to pick that up.

27
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,180
So that concludes target number six.
