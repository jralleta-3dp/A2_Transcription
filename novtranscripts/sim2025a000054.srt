1
00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:10,066
All right, coming up on my next, and I believe last target before the swap, wow, that time flew by, it's Tsiolkovsky Crater here and the Terminator.

2
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:20,000
So let's go in here and see that I'm looking for Tsiolkovsky, which is right along the Terminator.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,489
I actually can see it fairly decently popping out along the Terminator now.

4
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:30,915
And I can see that the central peak pops up in the middle.

5
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:33,490
Let me see if I can take a picture of that.

6
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:35,272
Let's see.

7
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,296
Same orientation as the last target.

8
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,621
So my head is pointing sort of toward the right here.

9
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,105
I'm going to take one all the way at 180.

10
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:47,812
And I'm going to zoom in to 400 here.

11
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:58,168
I will say, a couple times the cameras bumped the microphone, so I don't know how well that's going to impact audio quality.

12
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:02,157
But man, that central peak of Silkoski is beauty.

13
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:03,800
I can see why it's Reed's favorite crater.

14
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:07,947
Let's see.

15
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,070
Mosaic of Hull Terminator.

16
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,675
Okay, let's see here.

17
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,541
Highest focal length for individual features.

18
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,244
Oh boy, that's gonna be a lot of images.

19
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:24,595
As I'm saying this, I think that that South Polar Region mosaic wasn't necessarily all the way zoomed in, so I apologize for that.

20
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,626
All right, I got that mosaic.

21
00:01:54,928 --> 00:02:02,815
And now I'm looking at, for Tsiolkovsky, color-albedo texture variations, crater interior and exterior.

22
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:03,435
Let's see here.

23
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:21,632
So zooming in here, I do see, again, the crater, the inside of the crater is fully dark because it's in shadow, but you can see the central peak popping out, and it's nice and bright and white.

24
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,294
in the middle there, right in the middle of Tsiolkovsky's o'clock.

25
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:33,160
I can't tell, but it seems like in the sort of 10 to 11 p.m. if Tsiolkovsky was o'clock.

26
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:40,947
No, sorry, it's about nine o'clock if Tsiolkovsky was o'clock from my current body orientation.

27
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:43,329
There seems to be a light albedo patch.

28
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,934
I can't tell though if it's just because it's coming into the sun or not.

29
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:51,417
I'm gonna take a picture of it, see what you guys make of it.

30
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:53,999
All right.
