00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:02,169
All right, Angela, back with you.

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,512
I am starting Dewar Crater Region Crater Region.

3
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:07,073
I don't have the camera.

4
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:10,156
I'm looking with my eyes.

5
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:21,666
All right, let me try to identify Dewar Crater Region Region.

6
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,413
It's a little bit

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:55,553
hard because the base map in my LTP isn't like, is more topography based versus the albedo color.

8
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:04,588
Ah, OK. Yep, I got it.

9
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,509
I see it now.

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,552
Oh, if I look away, I almost lose it for a second.

11
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:10,673
But I can.

12
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:15,938
No, I lost it again.

13
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:27,647
No, I got it again.

14
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,149
OK. All right, all right, all right.

15
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:29,569
We're back.

16
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:30,670
I can see Dewar Crater Region.

17
00:01:31,291 --> 00:02:01,230
um what i'm really focusing on is the sharp perfect looking crater um fresh looking oh just kidding i lost it again sorry guys i'm really having a hard time trying to get

18
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:32,331
Doer It's almost like I really wish I had a camera to zoom in I definitely

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:03:03,448
I mean I can see I'm poking back to my lunar geography guide because the image there is a little bit better for me no I don't know what that Name is it's just I'm using the crater within a crater that's butting against another crater that's around the same diameter and then trying to look straight up from that

20
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,279
to identify Dewar Crater Region?

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,208
Okay, I think it's a darker mare patch in this area.

22
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:15,573
Okay, now I am confident I am looking at Dewar Crater Region.

23
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:31,478
The way I'm clocking it is the two craters that are around the same diameter and looking straight up at the darker region and then below this kind of light, very light and bright crater

24
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,715
above it, so I'm very confident I'm looking at it right now.

25
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:44,449
Again, this mare in Dewar Crater Region is very diffuse and it's also lighter in tone.

26
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:59,710
It's not as obvious as the rest of them, especially Aiken is pretty dark and so is Moskavians, but I'd say Dewar Crater Region is

27
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:05,820
Maybe what I'm looking at, maybe some of the lighter, lightest toned mare, if that makes sense.

28
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:11,786
Um, again, very diffuse, um, the extent of it.

29
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:22,556
Actually, maybe I can take a screenshot cause I feel like the image that I'm looking at is not accurately cubbying the full extent.

30
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:27,941
So standby as I take a tour region.

31
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:28,482
Oh yeah.

32
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:38,944
I can just annotate directly in to here in the LTP.

33
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:27,772
Okay, so I'm just drawing what I'm seeing as the boundary of this mare.

34
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:49,043
And then there seems to be another, maybe a slightly different tone of mare that's in an irregular shape around.

35
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,808
I drew the annotation.

36
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:57,517
Hopefully, I just want to show that there's a little bit of a boundary in the tones of the Mari in CoreLab.

37
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:04,686
But again, these are, in general, pretty diffuse boundaries, but there is a slight tonal difference.

38
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:19,165
So I wouldn't take that line as super sharp, but I can see a distinction in those shapes.
