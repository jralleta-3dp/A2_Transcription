1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,801
All right, moving on.

2
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:07,926
Again, I'm in window two with the camera and the shroud.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,569
Moving on to target four, Jackson Crater.

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:18,295
I'm looking at capturing this in the highest focal length.

5
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:21,298
So I've got the lens cranked over to 400.

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,703
First gonna start out with Jackson dead center at 400.

7
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,287
I cannot get the entire extent of the rays.

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:40,429
So I'm gonna zoom out, capture one that captures the visible part of the rays, which is almost two thirds of the moon at this point.

9
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:44,554
Still targeting the center of Jackson Crater.

10
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:55,448
And then go back to 400 and capture a mosaic that is at least 75% overlap across the top of Jackson.

11
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,375
Snaking west to east.

12
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,953
Gonna come back through Jackson.

13
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:14,948
And then a third pass just below Jackson.

14
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,265
I'm gonna go ahead and make a fourth pass from east to west.

15
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:33,103
Jackson now is not in the field of view, the crater proper, but the braid system from Jackson is.

16
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:53,113
And just to make sure that I continue to see rays extending to the south, so I'm going to make one last pass at 75% overlap, 400 zoom lens to make sure I capture the extent of any ray system coming out of Jackson.

17
00:01:54,207 --> 00:02:18,808
Going to close out that photo, documentation of Jackson again from centering Jackson with the red square at the full extent out on the zoom and slowly zoom in, keeping Jackson centered all the way to the 400 millimeter portion of the lens.

18
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,113
Incredible crater, incredible rays.

19
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,261
very distinct in the camera lens.

20
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:38,634
Maybe with my eye I can actually distinguish some of those rays a little bit further than what I was seeing in the camera lens, just based on these illumination conditions.

21
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:51,028
And I really hope I captured Jackson appropriately in the camera because it's a beautiful sight to see via the naked eye.

22
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,167
equally as impressive through the 400-meter lens.

23
00:02:54,227 --> 00:03:15,953
I wish I had a little bit more time to stare at it and pick up the nuance that the camera lens does afford me to look at, especially around the rim and some of the crater rings, or sorry, the crater ejecta rays to the south.

24
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:20,138
Really interested in that wedge that's between

25
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:45,045
uh 10 o'clock and two o'clock that doesn't look like there's any rays going to the to the north and west um kind of interesting just thought provoking as i kind of stare at it more through the camera lens took one last photo there i'm also gonna annotate that with the time stamp via the camera as soon as i close out this

26
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:55,254
audio file and it looks like, take one last check at the observation actions and looks like I'm good on Jackson.

27
00:03:55,294 --> 00:04:06,072
Again, gonna capture a audio note in the camera and hopefully get you some of these photos down at the soonest possibility that we have.
