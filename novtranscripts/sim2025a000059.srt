1
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,431
All right, starting target three, Orientale Basin.

2
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:15,482
Looking for a mosaic of the entire feature, west to east snake pattern with 50% overlap with the highest focal length.

3
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,426
So I'm at the 400 focal length.

4
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:30,162
First off, I'm gonna take more of a context photo of Orientale Basin with the red square dead center, and then start that mosaic.

5
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,805
So that should provide context for a mosaic.

6
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:42,985
I'm almost gonna go for 75% overlap and really blast across the top of Oriental, west to east.

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,616
Second pass.

8
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,751
Across the center of Oriental.

9
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:08,030
third pass across the bottom of Oriental.

10
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:17,480
Had a couple camera fires there that only caught one or two images out of the three stack.

11
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:27,210
And again, finishing off that target with a context photo at about mid-zoom level, about 200.

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,643
So I see that's a high-priority target.

13
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:41,128
It captured everything at least at 50% overlap.

14
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:46,594
Saw a lot of the annular ring and ejecta structure as I was taking those photos.

15
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:53,622
I'm also gonna make an annotation since that's a high-priority target with a wavefowl.

16
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:58,607
Standby for that, but incredible target overall.

17
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:03,913
The annular ring does start to pick up in that illumination condition.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,811
In fact, I'm going to take a few more photos just zoomed in right on the part dead center that I see the annular ring sticking up the most.

19
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,315
That's kind of at the three o'clock position.

20
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,419
Hip north is up the window north.

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,228
Also some spectacular topography seen at the smaller craters that are in Oriental.

22
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:31,757
And a really good contrast between the

23
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:40,520
the darker regions at the base of Oriental, the darker rim of Oriental, kind of from the 12 o'clock to the three o'clock.

24
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:46,005
And that topography really stands out, as I said, in this illumination condition.

25
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:54,393
Took a few more zoomed in pictures that just capture the entirety of Oriental.

26
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,977
I'm gonna try one using the camera in a vertical position.

27
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:12,088
And I'm going to end the recording here and put an audio recording to mark that in the D5.
