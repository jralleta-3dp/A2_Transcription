00:00:01,212 --> 00:00:02,093
Angela with you.

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:05,397
I got so distracted by my drawing at Dewar Crater Region Crater.

3
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,680
I didn't realize I had a high priority target up next.

4
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:20,414
So I think I'm a little bit, I'm definitely behind in my Sikofsky observations.

5
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:24,038
So apologies about that, but I hope you'll like that, that drawing.

6
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:27,962
Okay, I am,

7
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:59,012
trying to find Sikovsky yeah because I'm a little bit late to this observation I pretty much see the entire outline of Sikovsky and then the so like the rim of the west rim of Sikovsky is illuminated and the central peak is illuminated

8
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:01,758
That's the view I'm seeing right now.

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:24,072
So I missed the initial where it was just behind the Terminator because it looks fully outside of the Terminator.

10
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:41,197
I think the only, oh, and now that I'm looking at it, there's a little bit more of the basin of the crater that's illuminated.

11
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:51,032
So to the north of the central peak, there is a slight color that comes through.

12
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:58,243
I will screenshot it and, oh, wait, actually it's already in my, I keep forgetting that it's already in my LTP.

13
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:08,926
Are we taking a break?

14
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,895
Is it time?
