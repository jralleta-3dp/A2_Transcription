1
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:31,014
Okay All right, so just to make sure I'm on the right target it's the huge crater with lots of rays almost in a starship shape And it's got a it's a high albedo and

2
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,720
And I'm sort of in the north center field of view.

3
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,628
And I'm just doing target, not the whole moon, right?

4
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,529
And is that how you worked it, how you, one of you held the PCD?

5
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,750
No, you'd be going off of your own PCD.

6
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:10,950
Okay.

7
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:29,537
I mean, we can, I think if we're showing each other something, but I think the assumption is we're both initially orienting ourselves with this, and then we kind of wrap together if there's any question or I'm going to show you something I noticed, make sure you're going to exhibit it.

8
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:30,137
Okay.

9
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,278
Oh, there's the arthritis.

10
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,174
All right, so I'm gonna talk into my microphone a little bit here too.

11
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,215
I'm observing the earth rise.

12
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:09,177
It took me a while to get the camera sorted, but now it's going.

13
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:17,461
Christina's working on Jackson Crater, I think still, but I am just trying to capture the earth rise.

14
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:21,123
So I see a half earth.

15
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,985
I can see a very white south pole of the earth.

16
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,922
And I can see a landmass sort of in the middle.

17
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:36,565
And you could turn your pass through off too.

18
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,186
But you don't want to talk.

19
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,942
Okay, I'm there as well

20
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:31,653
mhm

21
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,111
Hey, Dre, can you hit target 20 on that thing for me?

22
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:52,892
That's what I do.

23
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:43,773
at least one newer crater on it that's very well defined and it might be the darkest actual region.

24
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:40,399
So do you want to just point at what you think you were filming there?

25
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,862
Yeah, so I see Aiken, right?

26
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:54,786
And then what I did have a little trouble coming up from Aiken and finding the things in between Aiken and there on that picture.

27
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:00,469
Like I see a really dark deep crater right above Aiken on there.

28
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:02,890
It doesn't show up at all on this.

29
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,251
I guess it's that, yeah.

30
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:17,133
I think we're quite a ways further up, actually.

31
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:18,053
Oh, I see the two.

32
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,154
Go up, up, up, up.

33
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:22,375
Up, up, up, up, up, that dark one there.

34
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,276
And you see the two to the right of it?

35
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:30,378
Yeah, I think they're identifiable right here.

36
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,359
No, these overlap, actually.

37
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,220
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

38
00:09:51,890 --> 00:10:00,773
Yeah, I think I was a little low initially Yeah, okay anyway all good learning Yeah

39
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:32,099
Yeah, I felt like I started photographing Earthrise when it happened, so.

40
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,501
No, you had to.

41
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,303
We're doing Earthrise site 21.

42
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,265
The exosphere just prior to Earthrise.

43
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:40,985
Oh.

44
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:47,610
So that's good to know.

45
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,752
Seeing Earth come out of the darkness.

46
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:19,517
Oops, sorry.

47
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:29,226
The balloons really stand out.

48
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,288
They're almost like a... Oh, I can't see.

49
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,750
I wasn't doing that.

50
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,494
I was trying to set up a five-minute timer.

51
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:38,734
Okay.

52
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,878
You know, because approximately,

53
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,146
It doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

54
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:39,245
Okay.

55
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:45,797
I have an idea on this because I think the social media and NatGeo people are perfect to just answer what they're seeing and leave the science people alone.

56
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:16,819
We really don't think we'll see out the other two windows?

57
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,179
Is that true?

58
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:20,320
I think you may see it out of that one.

59
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:29,563
I don't know that you're going to see it out of the side ones.

60
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:29,883
Really?

61
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,983
Oh, interesting.

62
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,015
Okay.
