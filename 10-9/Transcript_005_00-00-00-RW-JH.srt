Hello, perfect.

2
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:07,374
This is Marie making a recording of Crookes Crater.

3
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:15,580
And so I am looking at the crater with my eyes just out the window.

4
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,183
I can see that it is partway between Jackson Crater and Apollo Basin.

5
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:27,388
The Crookes Crater, you can see that it has an injected blanket and a couple of rays that come out.

6
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:33,884
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is very white compared to the surrounding as it's very bright.

7
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:46,268
Um, and almost looks, um, see, it is a, it is very similar in size.

8
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:51,730
It almost looks like the majority of the race system could fit inside, um, Apollo basin.

9
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,172
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is about that size.

10
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,018
It's very bright.

11
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,379
It's very white.

12
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:05,203
I can't really see any shadows here based on our geometry because I'm essentially looking straight down on it.

13
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:15,810
I can't really see much structure to it, but you do see that white circle interior of the crater.

14
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,534
It does stand out as brighter from the ejecta blanket.

15
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:35,586
Um, it does look like it is the, um, it almost looks like a ejecta, an ejecta ray from Jackson actually goes over it.

16
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:40,649
Um, and it looks very much like a, um, it just passes right through.

17
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,414
So I think that it is underneath one of those rays that is coming down from Jackson crater.

18
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:46,474
Um,

19
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:59,399
It's really neat to see all these bright spots with all these rays right now in this lighting and really excited to move on to our next target.
