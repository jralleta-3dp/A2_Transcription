23:52:04,310 --> 23:52:07,652
All right, I am going to do a recording of mare ingenii.

2
23:52:07,672 --> 23:52:10,774
So I am looking at the crater.

3
23:52:11,674 --> 23:52:15,937
It is partway down to the South Pole.

4
23:52:16,057 --> 23:52:25,002
It's really easy to see the swirling that we have in mare ingenii here that looks like white streaks, curly, swirly streaks going across.

5
23:52:25,702 --> 23:52:31,826
It seems like those swirls are most prevalent in the bottom half of that mare field.

6
23:52:34,643 --> 23:52:40,325
As you go up a little higher, actually the whole, it almost looks like an eyeball.

7
23:52:40,505 --> 23:52:45,567
And so if you see that darker part of the mare pond, it is darker in color.

8
23:52:45,587 --> 23:52:47,808
It doesn't really have as many of those swirls.

9
23:52:48,188 --> 23:52:52,250
But when you look around the outside, it's almost like where the iris of the eye would be.

10
23:52:52,690 --> 23:52:56,451
You can see those swirls very similarly to the veins that you would see in your eye.

11
23:52:59,315 --> 23:53:05,299
The texture along the right side of the crater, it's sort of a rubbly texture.

12
23:53:06,620 --> 23:53:12,123
You can tell that there's just a lot of broken down material near where the crater rim would have been.

13
23:53:12,143 --> 23:53:23,530
And the interesting thing is also just looking at this, I see a lot of that orange brown rusty color that matches some of the other mare infills that we see in South Pole Lake and Basin.

14
23:53:26,420 --> 23:53:36,412
It's really cool to see these swirls in exactly where they're supposed to be and they really do look similar to what we are seeing in Muscoviense as well.
