1
23:45:01,222 --> 23:45:05,037
All right, coming up on the Dewar Crater region here.

2
23:45:06,882 --> 23:45:11,584
I think I'll be, well, someone will be getting the opportunity to look at it again later.

3
23:45:12,744 --> 23:45:20,328
But for right now, I see it's fairly close to the terminator edge.

4
23:45:20,788 --> 23:45:32,413
I know I'm looking for a sort of albedo anomaly here and looking for some sort of like darker material that kind of comes out from the bottom of Dewar.

5
23:45:34,133 --> 23:45:35,454
I think I see it.

6
23:45:35,834 --> 23:45:37,034
It's more diffuse.

7
23:45:37,514 --> 23:45:46,776
I don't really see, it's not like constrained or confined to a crater, but rather it appears to be darker material.

8
23:45:46,836 --> 23:45:56,579
I don't see a ton of like vibrant colors, but it's definitely darker material that's kind of coming out like to the, almost like the southeast of Dewar Crater.

9
23:45:59,780 --> 23:46:01,660
Let's see, size, it's probably like,

10
23:46:03,065 --> 23:46:11,272
maybe one Dewar Crater diameter, long away from, again, the southeast edge of Dewar Crater.

11
23:46:11,292 --> 23:46:19,518
And again, it's diffuse, even the sort of like the boundaries of the Albedo Anomaly itself are fairly diffuse.

12
23:46:20,719 --> 23:46:26,604
It also kind of comes up like sort of to the east and the north a bit, again, diffused.

13
23:46:26,684 --> 23:46:29,487
It almost looks like, I don't know, like someone

14
23:46:30,047 --> 23:46:38,279
sprayed flour on the lunar surface or something and it sort of came out in an irregular pattern from the middle of Dewar crater.

15
23:46:40,001 --> 23:46:41,664
Let's see what else I can tell you here.

16
23:46:46,018 --> 23:46:52,700
Texture-wise, it doesn't appear to have an underlying consistent texture that's associated with the albedo anomaly.

17
23:46:52,720 --> 23:47:01,142
I can't quite tell if there's any sort of surface texture associated with it, which makes me think there likely isn't.

18
23:47:01,202 --> 23:47:07,004
It really just does appear to be a darker patch of lunar surface.

19
23:47:07,564 --> 23:47:08,284
I hope that's helpful.

20
23:47:08,304 --> 23:47:09,585
Looking forward to round two.
