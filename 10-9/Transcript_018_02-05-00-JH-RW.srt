1
02:05:02,082 --> 02:05:02,902
Alright, this is Maria.

2
02:05:02,943 --> 02:05:13,989
I'm gonna again talk through the Terminator because I did it once already but completely missed it the last time so I guess I'll just take a new mosaic.

3
02:05:14,609 --> 02:05:17,310
So I'm gonna just take a higher resolution one.

4
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:23,454
I did just finish a mosaic before but I will do another one because I want to talk through the recording.

5
02:05:26,036 --> 02:05:28,837
So, I am snaking my way up.

6
02:05:29,698 --> 02:05:31,339
Oh, there's Mare Injunai.

7
02:05:31,379 --> 02:05:33,680
I can really see that in the swirls there.

8
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:39,282
I'm working my way up from there, and then I'm going to snake over closer to the Terminator.

9
02:05:39,723 --> 02:05:44,625
Right now, the Terminator is not in my view, but I'll get over there.

10
02:05:44,685 --> 02:05:53,469
It's really interesting to see the depressions, the difference in the amount of depression that you see in these critters.

11
02:05:54,525 --> 02:05:56,187
as I work my way up here.

12
02:05:56,267 --> 02:05:58,109
I'm up near the North Pole now.

13
02:05:58,289 --> 02:06:00,551
I'm gonna snake over a little bit more to the left.

14
02:06:02,453 --> 02:06:07,157
Sounds like they're working on the toilet behind me, but glad they can get that checked out.

15
02:06:07,177 --> 02:06:09,820
Now I'm up in Muscoviense.

16
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,461
I'm working my way back down.

17
02:06:11,902 --> 02:06:15,525
There's that little tiny mare-filled crater not too far below it.

18
02:06:16,886 --> 02:06:18,568
Now I'm working my way back down.

19
02:06:20,275 --> 02:06:27,720
Making sure that I have- oh, now I'm back at Jules Verne with those scarps.

20
02:06:27,981 --> 02:06:29,202
Back over to the left.

21
02:06:30,222 --> 02:06:32,304
And now I have the Terminator in view.

22
02:06:32,404 --> 02:06:33,665
There I am at that.

23
02:06:49,501 --> 02:06:56,411
make sure that I get and now the moon is the earth is back in that view also absolutely incredible view here
