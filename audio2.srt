1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,804
Okay, what do we got here?

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:03,385
What's next?

3
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:05,808
What's next Buys-Ballot?

4
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,930
Oh I'm not sure.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,711
I remember this too.

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:12,496
Well, you're gonna need to give me some direction Yeah, I'm gonna need to give myself some direction.

7
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,718
All right, let's pull up the lunar geography review.

8
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:17,241
I know we're on the far side Clicking in there

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,472
Oh gosh, it's not even on this medium label.

10
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:21,132
It's right.

11
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:21,552
Yeah.

12
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:21,932
Okay.

13
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:23,913
Oh, wow.

14
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:24,313
Okay.

15
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,834
That's a small sucker.

16
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:26,934
Okay.

17
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:30,136
It should be like halfway between Jackson and Moscoviense.

18
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,136
So let's see here.

19
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:34,337
Let me go back to the targeting plan.

20
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:35,978
Let me see what we got.

21
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:36,458
Okay.

22
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,499
This is tough.

23
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:40,640
What am I even looking at here?

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,240
Where?

25
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,201
I got my camera ready.

26
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:47,025
Should Moscoviense be off to the west, Angela?

27
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:47,986
I don't know.

28
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,108
I can't see Moscoviense anymore.

29
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,970
Oh, is there a possibility?

30
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,751
Is this upside down?

31
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,754
All right, let me flip this upside down here.

32
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:56,315
What do we got?

33
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:57,897
Okay.

34
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:02,919
So the image in the targeting plan was upside down, but now I think I got it.

35
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,082
So I think I see Jackson Crater, that really popped.

36
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:13,226
So it looks like Buys-Ballot, yep, they're telling me it should be pretty, pretty close to... How pretty is pretty?

37
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,727
That's a good question.

38
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,189
Like the size of Jackson?

39
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,490
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,112
It's maybe like, it's about the size of Jackson and it's maybe about like...

41
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:40,734
i don't even know eight to ten jackson diameters which direction to the i think if i'm looking at this right it's to the west to the west so yeah okay yeah all right so i think i got it here that took a while sorry about that shape stuff because i'm looking at a lot of graders that might be around that size

42
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,518
Yeah, the shape, wow, look at this.

43
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:48,922
This is, this almost looks like, I don't know, like an arrowhead or something.

44
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,804
Like it's, it's... Oh, I got it.

45
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,544
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,725
I'll take some pictures now.

47
00:01:52,966 --> 00:02:01,213
Yeah, it's like an arrowhead feature and there's actually like a higher topographic ridge that runs through the middle of Buys-Ballot.

48
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:01,973
So let me see here.

49
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:24,758
yeah and it's it's kind of sitting on or under i can't quite tell from here no it's got to be sitting on a crater that's just sort of at the fat arrowhead end yeah and it's that that one it's sitting on looks like it's got more muted topography i'm thinking and the tip of the arrow is kind of pointing at like uh oh i guess it's telling me on the ltp it's the Lacus Luxuriae Region

50
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:25,398
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:26,839
It looks like kind of like a spillout.

52
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:27,459
Yeah.

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,540
It's a dark kind of like grayish blue looking.

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,021
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:31,421
Okay.

56
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,981
I'll take some pictures of that.

57
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:43,666
Slightly the area outside of Buys-Ballot is kind of like darker and albedo and then Boy's Ballad does look kind of crisp next to the surrounding features I'm thinking.

58
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:48,328
Does it look like it's spilling out because it kind of looks like it's coming from maybe that arrow point to me?

59
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:49,008
Maybe.

60
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,309
It's kind of hard to tell and I guess

61
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:56,370
Yeah, I mean, maybe one edge of Buys-Ballot looks more muted in topography than the other edge.

62
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,711
Do you see what I'm saying here?

63
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,171
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,113
I mean, it might be the shadows, but yeah, I see what you mean by that.

65
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,335
Alright, I'll be honest.

66
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:04,615
I'm not too sure what's going on here.

67
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:09,018
I know that there can be some weird-looking craters, but this one is an oddball.

68
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,682
I think all we can really do here, Angela, is get some pictures of it and hope that the science team back on Earth can figure this out for us.

69
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:24,535
Yep, I'll make sure that my focus of my camera is all over that area so you can maybe do some cool stuff with the photos, but I got the pictures.

70
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,058
Alright, moving on.
