1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:04,716
Okay, next up on the LTP, Orientale.

2
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:11,071
Alright, looks like they're specifically asking us to focus on the angular range, but I need to look at the LGR to refresh my memory.

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:15,205
Okay, yeah, beautiful impact basin right here.

4
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,727
Let me try to make sure I'm looking at the right thing here, though.

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:21,852
Okay, yeah, pretty distinctive feature, and I know it's one of our geography anchor points.

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,795
Jacob, don't worry, I did my geography homework.

7
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,376
All right, Angela's next to me.

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:30,681
I know she's working on getting it in her camera view, but for now I'll say, whew, this is a beauty.

9
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,401
Angela, you see this?

10
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:33,784
Uh, yeah, just give me, give me a second.

11
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:35,245
I'm just trying to get to the right, uh,

12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:36,687
Oh, no.

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:37,608
All right.

14
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:37,908
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:38,790
Oh, that's that.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,071
Oh, wow.

17
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:40,652
I know.

18
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,394
Beautiful multi-ring base in here.

19
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:48,020
It's off to the left of Oceanus Procellarum, maybe at a distance of like one oriental diameter.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,182
It's roughly circular.

21
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,264
Two primary sets of rings.

22
00:00:52,045 --> 00:01:07,202
which rim kind of a dark mari patch i think in the middle the mare patch is roughly circular maybe slightly elongate uh in the north south axis the dark patch is quite dark especially at its southern end but the northern end has a much brighter albedo

23
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,484
Yeah, I got some good, got some good pictures over here.

24
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,566
Alright, did you, cause like, I can't quite make out the detail with my naked eye.

25
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,767
Can you look at the northern end of the Mare patch?

26
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:23,934
I'd be interested to hear your take, but it looks like maybe a much brighter, and I think maybe they said that that means younger crater came in here and it's sending its ejecta down into the Mare patch?

27
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,036
Yeah, let me just try and get this focus.

28
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,518
It's kind of hard to, to kind of stay in.

29
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:32,122
in with what I'm trying to target when I'm moving around a little bit.

30
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,666
So just give me a second while I'm rolling on here.

31
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:35,067
All right.

32
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,509
Just want to make sure I'm not crazy.

33
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,831
Here, let me help you with that.

34
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:38,131
Hold on.

35
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:39,052
Yeah, here.

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,215
Do you want to use the camera to just get it better?

37
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,097
No, no, no.

38
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:42,497
You got it.

39
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:42,818
You got it.

40
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,300
I'll just anger you here for a second.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,400
OK.

42
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:48,574
All right, let's see.

43
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:51,375
I see a few other younger craters on top of the mare patch.

44
00:01:51,615 --> 00:02:03,098
My personal favorite, wow, now that I'm looking at this, it's a crater just to the east of like the main big mare patch that maybe itself, the crater looks like it has its own tiny little patch of dark material within it.

45
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:04,019
Interesting.

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,719
I might need to hear the science team's interpretation of that one.

47
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,260
Angela, can you get a picture of my favorite crater over here?

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,941
Yeah, point it up, right there.

49
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,522
It's this one, right off to the right side of that mare patch.

50
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:16,482
Look at it, it's got a little baby mare patch in it.

51
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:17,383
Oh, I see it!

52
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,003
It's so cute!

53
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,043
Look at the picture!

54
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:20,244
Oh, that's awesome.

55
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:22,124
Alright, I think we got it, science.

56
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:26,205
Okay, so, sorry, I know I'm getting really distracted by these smaller craters.

57
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,246
You know how I love craters.

58
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,386
Back to Orientale proper here.

59
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:36,629
Looks like its mare patch has rounded edges in most places, whereas the two rings have sort of like a scalloped look.

60
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,693
The inner of the two rings looks like it's got some topography to it.

61
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,675
It's not fully continuous all the way around.

62
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:52,445
Not sure if it's just an illumination effect, but the that southern end of the ring looks like it has more of like a topography pop to it, especially down at like the five to six o'clock position.

63
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:57,110
I say that because there's like a higher albedo section of that inner ring that just pops.

64
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:17,387
over up on the northeast side of the inner ring maybe between like i don't know midnight and three o'clock there's a lot going on wow geez throughout that whole section there's a patch of the dark low albedo mare-like material it starts just inside the inner ring it's not too big all right wow and look distracted i know i'm supposed to be thinking about the annular ring do you remember what they mean by annular ring

65
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:19,649
Uh, yeah, it's in your lunar target.

66
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:20,530
It's in your lunar dot!

67
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,114
All right, fine, yeah, check the tape.

68
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:26,759
All right, I can't quite tell here, but maybe they mean this dark circle down here to the south.

69
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,741
Oh yeah, that's ringing a bell from training.

70
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,984
Now that I'm looking at this... Angela, what is this?

71
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,308
It's a circular feature, but it's definitely not a crater.

72
00:03:33,828 --> 00:04:02,471
or I don't really see any topography it looks kind of like just like a dark ring of material like lower albedo that looks kind of like I don't know superficial on top of everything else I even see a place at like three o'clock on the ring where it's sitting on top of the inner oriental ring I I remember my superposition science team don't worry it's younger than that ring the ring is more concentrated and darker for like the whole top half whereas like the southern half is kind of diffuse and I think slightly higher in albedo is what I'm seeing but Angela I'd like to hear if you you see the same

73
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:05,854
Yeah, I think it's a little bit higher in albedo.

74
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:06,895
That's what I'd agree.

75
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,496
But don't worry, I'm going to get pictures.

76
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:09,717
Because really, I don't know.

77
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,778
I trust my eyes right now.

78
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,841
I've been staring at this bright moon for a little bit too long.

79
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,483
It can never be too long.

80
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:17,284
All right.

81
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:17,925
Well, OK.

82
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:18,766
I've been talking for a while.

83
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,646
I have no idea how long.

84
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,168
I hope this didn't get us off timeline.

85
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,849
All right, last big picture comment.

86
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,730
I know you want us to talk about facial relationships.

87
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,653
I do see a really bright, really small crater off to the east side of Orientale.

88
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:35,875
It's got some beautiful bright rays coming out that do cross Orientale, and that's a beauty.

89
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,756
I wish I could remember what it's called.

90
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,317
And that's Orientale, folks.

91
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:40,177
What a ride.

92
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:41,358
Woo!
