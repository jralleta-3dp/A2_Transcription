00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,184
This is Marie with ImageBee.

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:05,286
So what feature am I looking at?

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:14,052
I'm looking at an Earthrise, a picture of the Earth shining on the moon with my eyeballs on a computer screen.

4
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,395
This target was outlined in the email you sent me.

5
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:34,099
So we can see that the part of the moon that we are looking at is on the eastern limb and then we see half of the Earth's hemisphere.

6
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:42,522
It looks like potentially the part showing California and the United States is lit compared to the dark

7
00:00:44,279 --> 00:01:13,334
the dark side of the the words uh only only one hemisphere as expected of the earth is lit and that hemisphere is closer to the uh lunar surface um and so as we said the earth is located to the in in our viewing angle to the right of the moon um it is much smaller and is similar in size to the complex crater

8
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:16,355
that is visible on the surface of the moon.

9
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:21,559
That's obviously just my eyeballs connecting that.

10
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:31,346
The edges of the moon are very smooth, and then the Terminator is sort of fuzzy.

11
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:38,471
Let's see, you can actually see the color of the Earth.

12
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,932
You can see the whitishness of the clouds.

13
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,353
You can see the blue of the water.

14
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:46,165
the greenish brown of the land masses.

15
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:53,150
And that is shining a bluish tinted light onto the lunar surface.

16
00:01:54,731 --> 00:02:03,418
And so we can see part of the lunar surface illuminated there with some complex craters and other craters.

17
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:10,043
So we can see a lot of topography there that is evident by it being along the limb.

18
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:18,863
And so that texture on the moon is very rough.

19
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:24,225
And we can see it following different topographic features.

20
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:27,906
However, on the Earth, it looks very smooth.

21
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:36,409
We can see a lot of topography on the moon within the crater structures.

22
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,351
It's unable to see if any of these craters are infilled

23
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:46,575
or use color to our advantage to define that.

24
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,726
Gosh, this is beautiful.

25
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:58,140
Just looking at that whole earth right there that all of us are on while we are flying past the moon.

26
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,585
These astronauts are in for a treat.

27
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:02,469
We'll call that good.
