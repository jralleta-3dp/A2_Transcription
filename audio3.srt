1
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,655
Alright, okay, I gotta take a moment to collect myself here.

2
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:08,237
Next target.

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,118
What do we have?

4
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:12,561
Okay, looking for a description of Terminator morphology, I think?

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,442
Let me get oriented.

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,023
Whoa!

7
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,045
Whoa!

8
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:16,726
Angela, you guys!

9
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:17,707
You're not gonna believe this!

10
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:18,047
What?

11
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,490
I really think I just saw a flash here!

12
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,110
No, you didn't!

13
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,594
No, it was a bright white flash, really tiny, but it was there.

14
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:25,215
Did you see it, Trevor?

15
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:26,676
Yeah, come on over here.

16
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,017
Well, I guess you missed it now, huh?

17
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,158
I wonder if any of the saw cameras caught that.

18
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:36,763
It was just like a bright white light over there in the unilluminated portion of the moon, really fleeting, but that was inspiring.

19
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:37,503
Where was it?

20
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:43,167
Well, so here I am in the port forward window, and I think it was kind of like off in the upper right quadrant of my view here.

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,070
Wow, that was incredible.

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,751
I hope you can pull this out of other vehicle data.

23
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:49,652
I mean, wow.

24
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,753
We got to get a seismometer on the moon ASAP.

25
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:56,275
I'll be honest, I was kind of skeptical we'd see one of these, but we sure got lucky.

26
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,055
What an experience.

27
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:02,478
I think I remember this was really high priority for the lunar science team, so I'm really glad we got this data point for them.

28
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,059
All right, mark the time that you've seen it.

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,379
Yeah.
