00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:14,486
All right, for image C, that is the terminator and the limb of the moon that I am looking at as a target from the email you sent me.

2
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:19,790
And I am identifying it with my eyeballs on a computer screen just in front of me.

3
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:26,955
I can see the sliver, looks like the crescent of the moon.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,725
on the eastern limb that is illuminated with the rest of the lunar surface being dark.

5
00:00:43,146 --> 00:01:00,315
You can see that there are some you can see some evidence of craters potentially some linear features in there as well along there it's sort of it's

6
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,657
very slim margin of the moon.

7
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:11,043
Let's see, you can see part of it is potentially a mare region.

8
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:18,830
The outer edge of the moon has a very crisp edge and the terminator edge is a little bit fuzzier.

9
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:29,399
Along the, we see for color the whiter outside and it becomes grayer as we get closer to the terminator.

10
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:42,395
Inside one of the craters that is seen from about a quarter of the way down, you can see a very dark interior and then you see a linear raised topographic feature coming out.

11
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:54,105
And then you can see craters mostly on the lower half of the crescent that are more evident there.

12
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:02,179
Yeah, the top has more of a grayer tone than the bottom half.

13
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,163
It has a higher contrast of features.

14
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:12,331
The texture towards the southern part of the crescent is rougher.

15
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,974
It looks smoother towards the upper part.

16
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,423
see topography.

17
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,984
You can actually see raised crater rims.

18
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:35,228
You can see looks like some peak structures down towards the bottom part potentially that raise a linear feature towards the top.

19
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:44,070
We can see some topography as I have talked about.

20
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,711
We see that there is light coming

21
00:02:48,028 --> 00:03:00,165
we talked about the light coming onto the surface of the moon from the east and like towards the equatorial region is where that light is the brightest.

22
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:12,798
geologic relationships in the upper portion of the crescent on what appears could be a grayer region which is more of a mare region.

23
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:19,804
You can see a raised rim of a crater with that linear feature on top of the potentially on top of the mare.

24
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:26,410
And you can see overlapping of craters in the southern part.

25
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:31,934
This is another very pretty one.

26
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,597
Every- my impressions every time I look at these, they're beautiful.

27
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:43,006
And... That's it.

28
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:50,879
Hopefully this isn't what the moon's gonna look like when they're seeing it because that means we are about to go around and just stare at a dark moon.

29
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,321
And that'd be pretty sad.

30
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,884
Okay.

31
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:54,485
Done.
