1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,622
All right, we are recording for a minute.

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:08,446
We're in the ESCO lab looking at the lunar target guide and visual cues.

3
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:21,456
And you'll see impact crater is located on the far side with sharply defined rim, a complex central peak structure, terraced wall, and expansive ray system.

4
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:22,637
So now you know that.

5
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:26,019
Let's see, lunar geography review.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,562
We have some tabs in here, view, general notes.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:42,772
Guidance for imaging and observations, we have our cue card tab, and then our cue cards have, they're not filled out, so I can't read those.

8
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:48,137
But in theory, there will be specific things in these cue cards.

9
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,560
Now I don't know how long I've talked, 50 seconds, 51, 52.

10
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,527
And we'll record for a minute, and then we'll stop it.

11
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,160
Three more seconds, two, one, and.
