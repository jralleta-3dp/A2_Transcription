00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:01,808
Christina here.

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:06,789
Moving on to my next target, which is Apollo Basin, target number 17.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:19,692
I did a lot of descriptions on Apollo Basin when I compared it to Oppenheimer for target 16, but I'm going to continue on focusing on Apollo Basin.

4
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:23,953
So the first thing I'll note is the color tones.

5
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:30,515
And there doesn't seem to be a significant color tone difference in

6
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:51,782
The kind of inner ring of the basin and the exterior ring of the basin They seem to be around the same color tone, which is in the mare this dark blue Very dark kind of black blue color and then everything else which has a slight kind of reddish gray

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,179
tone to it.

8
00:00:54,139 --> 00:01:11,589
With the exception of maybe like three pretty bright craters that stand out, the one that stands out the most is kind of the northeast of the mare that's inside of the inner basin.

9
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:25,224
and it stands out because it has rays that are maybe like four rays that are clearly cutting across that mare, that irregular shaped mare, and it seems like those rays are

10
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:33,673
you know, they're very clear because they have a contrast in the dark mares because they're such light tone.

11
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,116
And then they continue on, but the end of it is a little bit diffuse.

12
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:42,740
I know I can't see those rays on the other side of that inner ring.

13
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,262
So they seem to be constrained in some way to the inner ring.

14
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:52,026
And their direction is kind of north,

15
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:58,804
northwest, cutting diagonally down and across.

16
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:13,495
And then the other two brighter craters that stand out are outside of that inner basin and slightly to the east of the dark mare patch that's

17
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,231
on the left side of the basin.

18
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:21,855
If you're looking at it like a face, it's the left eye of that mare patch.

19
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:24,376
It's a little bit to the right of it.

20
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:34,842
And then if you're looking at the smile, right above, north of the smile, that's the other kind of bright crater.

21
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:36,984
So there's that kind of three bright craters that stand out.

22
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:42,507
And I've kind of tried to describe them in association with the mare, but hopefully that comes through in the pictures.

23
00:02:50,803 --> 00:03:00,608
In general, in terms of the texture, Apollo Basin seems a lot smoother, especially in the kind of mare regions.

24
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:14,694
Definitely seems like they're a little bit more of a flow or a mantled type of smooth look versus Oppenheimer, which has a little bit more ruggedness to it.

25
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:26,926
And like I mentioned, there's more contrast and sharpness in the boundaries of those dark patches in Apollo Basin than Oppenheimer.

26
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:43,773
And the last thing I'll say is it does seem like Oppenheimer is

27
00:03:47,391 --> 00:04:01,616
kind of physically on top of Apollo Basin, like it's cutting into it, it's cutting off a little bit of the margin, and then there's these rays that are cutting straight through from a crater above.
