00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:16,885
Okay, here I am at window two and I think the next target on my list here is buys ballot and I remember this one from training and I'll be honest, I'm pretty glad I get the chance to observe it because of

2
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:18,708
how unique it is.

3
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:25,736
It does have that kind of arrowhead shape where the point of the arrow is pointing to the south.

4
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:37,389
It has a long linear ridge in the middle that I would have believed is a central peak but it's so linear and stretched out it looks like it's rising above a relatively smooth terrain here.

5
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:49,499
Speaking of that smooth terrain, sort of the like upper northern end of the bottom of the crater looks pretty smooth.

6
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:57,684
It's got like some younger fresher craters that look like they've formed in the smooth mare.

7
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:58,585
They're dark

8
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:00,286
smooth patch.

9
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:05,909
But it that that sort of northern part is really, you know, quite smooth.

10
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:12,133
And then as you move to the south toward, you know, the other end of that linear ridge in the middle of the crater, it looks like rougher terrain.

11
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:16,756
And it almost looks like that rougher terrain ends in sort of like an arc.

12
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:22,301
that starts in the west, goes slightly up to the north, then goes back down to the east.

13
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:29,287
There's also another little, like, arc, almost like a slump or something on the east side of the crater.

14
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:41,078
I would say the east side of the crater looks, I think, like a shallower slope, whereas the west side is a steeper slope.

15
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:53,574
really interesting diversity in this crater from the sort of lumpy, hummocky texture to the south and the smooth texture to the north.

16
00:01:54,495 --> 00:02:07,200
As for like color and albedo, I'd say the fresher or the smoother stuff is grayer, much grayer than the southern edge, which is like a lighter gray tone.

17
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:22,179
So I definitely see a kind of a distinct color difference there Looks like you guys want me to draw some comparisons about Lacus luxuriate to the south Man, that thing is is hard to kind of see and pick out.

18
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:32,221
It's much less Topographically notable than buys ballot But really interesting feature here and

19
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:38,088
making sure I'm not missing any of your requests.

20
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,850
Yeah, the texture I think I covered.

21
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:50,075
We got the steep slope to the west, the shallower slope to the east that really has that hummocky slump-like terrain.

22
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,698
And again, rougher to the south.

23
00:02:55,778 --> 00:03:02,762
And I mean, I still see some tiny fresher craters there in the southern rougher patch.

24
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:10,318
but much different than the sort of other smooth material in Lacus Luxuriae.

25
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,263
Really interesting crater and I'm excited to see what you guys make of it.
