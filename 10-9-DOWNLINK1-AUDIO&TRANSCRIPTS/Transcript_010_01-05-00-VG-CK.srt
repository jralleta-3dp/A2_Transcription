00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:05,158
All right, moving on to target 20, the PoincarÃ© Crater region.

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:16,647
I've been staring at this one for a little bit now before I started this recording, and I'm looking for that stratigraphic relationship that's called out for this basin.

3
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:30,118
I totally understand that it's within SPA, or at least in a Western region of SPA, but I'm trying to look for this resurface volcanism

4
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,864
And it's just not standing out to me.

5
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,905
Maybe it's the illumination condition on this one.

6
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:47,933
Maybe it's because of that being near the Terminator, but I'm not picking up on the things, the actions that are outlined in the LTP.

7
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:59,140
Color's pretty diffuse across this one, not picking up any kind of color differentiation that, at least from my eyes and at this, you know, without a,

8
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:03,079
optical device to get any closer in on it.

9
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,340
Wrinkle ridges, not seeing any.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,042
The basin rings, I can't see that it's a basin, but I kind of have to squint to see that in that area.

11
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:19,884
And the mari relationships, just because it's all tonal, about the same down there in this illumination conditions.

12
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:22,385
Not, not

13
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,004
not anything's really standing out to me.

14
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:38,419
So sorry, this one might be a dud for you guys, but really not seeing anything standing out in that area that gets me at the stratigraphic relationship or the volcanic activity in this area.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,003
Sorry about that one, but moving on to the next one.
