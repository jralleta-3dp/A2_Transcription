00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:06,228
This is Marie making observations with the camera.

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,869
I'm trying to find Bozum Ballot.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,651
Bozum Ballot.

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:11,471
Nope.

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,272
Bozum Baba.

6
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:13,572
Crater right now.

7
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:15,253
Craters.

8
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:24,119
I know that they're below Apollo Basin, but it's actually, at this lighting, it's really hard to pull them out because of the morphology is making it

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:29,137
more difficult to find exactly where the craters are.

10
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:46,326
And so what I'm doing instead is I'm just going to take a bunch of pictures of this bottom rim below Apollo Basin at the highest resolution that I can and try hopefully that you'll be able to see.

11
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,147
So I'm sure that I will have captured it.

12
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,282
might not be in the middle of the frame.

13
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:17,208
Yeah, without that defining morphology, it's actually pretty difficult to see, but I can still see a lot of that rusty brown color down here, and so the rims of the craters aren't as well pronounced, and so it's definitely a more difficult one to find, but hopefully the pictures help.
