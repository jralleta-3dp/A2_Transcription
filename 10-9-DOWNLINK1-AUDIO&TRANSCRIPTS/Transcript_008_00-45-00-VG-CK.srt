1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:04,222
Christina here, working through my targeting.

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:08,966
Next up is number 16, Oppenheimer.

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:19,436
I am looking through the camera at the moment, and so I can get pretty close, zoomed in.

4
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:23,980
Oppenheimer and Apollo Basin right next to each other.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,822
I'll say the first thing that stands out to me

6
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:28,258
are the color tones.

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,842
Oppenheimer has kind of this reddish hue to it, with its mare being more like almost like a dark purple.

8
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:44,844
And the mares that are really standing out to me are the kind of three

9
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:51,207
to the left side of the crater.

10
00:00:52,489 --> 00:01:11,047
And then as you go more towards Apollo Basin, the color tone changes pretty significantly because you have this big ray, this light-toned ray that's coming from Crooks that is just almost cutting

11
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:13,254
Oppenheimer in half.

12
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:29,341
It's going kind of close to straight up and down through the crater and proceeds double the length, at least, past the crater as well.

13
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:39,205
And in that ray, there's actually two tones of this kind of lighter hue that's also about equal

14
00:01:41,290 --> 00:02:01,398
on so i'll say that if you kind of split that ray in half vertically on the left side of it has this more of a maybe we'll call it like a tan like a a tanner browner light toned color and then on the right side of it closer to apollo basin it's definitely more of a

15
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:08,676
a lighter tan, I'll say, but there's a little bit of tonal difference with the lighter color closer towards Apollo Basin.

16
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:18,244
And then as you move more towards Apollo Basin, you have a reddish tone, but it's a little bit lighter than what I'm seeing in Oppenheimer.

17
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:26,312
And then the Mare also, instead of like the dark purples, if you call it like a little bit of darker purple in the Mare,

18
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:32,518
In Oppenheimer, in Apollo, it's more of like a bluer in the mare.

19
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:38,182
And then go into texture.

20
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:47,388
Let's see, Oppenheimer is a little bit, maybe I'd call it rougher than Apollo overall.

21
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:04,887
And I'm definitely seeing these kind of finer structures that are at the base, at the kind of basin of Oppenheimer.

22
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:13,653
And I can even see them in my LTP, but yeah, they're not present in Apollo either.

23
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:22,320
So I just see these kind of linear fractures and structures in Oppenheimer at the, at its basin.

24
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:40,078
Overall though, these kind of the margins of the mare, I would say, are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than Apollo.

25
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,903
Like there are some margins, like I said, those three kind of primary mare are what stands out.

26
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:50,405
And what I mean by that,

27
00:03:53,462 --> 00:04:03,470
are there's the very circular, so if you're talking about Oppenheimer on the kind of left side of it, there's a really circular mare which has like two

28
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,361
it kind of horizontal notches to it.

29
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:12,942
And then below that, a little to the left, you have a little bit of a smaller splotch.

30
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:18,483
And then a little bit below that, a little bit more to the right, there's kind of a dark, diffuse mare patch.

31
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:30,246
Whereas Apollo, it's very clear that there are, instead of, like I said, the margins are more diffuse in Oppenheimer than they are in Apollo.

32
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:33,807
The Apollo mare is very clear,

33
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:43,998
lineation and differentiation between the light and the dark of the mare and the light-toned surrounding area.
