Hello, perfect.

2
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:07,374
This is Marie making a recording of Crook's Crater.

3
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:15,580
And so I am looking at the crater with my eyes just out the window.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,183
I can see that it is partway between Jackson Crater and Apollo Basin.

5
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:27,388
The Crook's Crater, you can see that it has an injected blanket and a couple of rays that come out.

6
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:33,884
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is very white compared to the surrounding as it's very bright.

7
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:46,268
Um, and almost looks, um, see, it is a, it is very similar in size.

8
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:51,730
It almost looks like the majority of the race system could fit inside, um, Apollo basin.

9
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:56,172
Um, and so that ejecta blanket is about that size.

10
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,018
It's very bright.

11
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:59,379
It's very white.

12
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,203
I can't really see any shadows here based on our geometry because I'm essentially looking straight down on it.

13
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:15,810
I can't really see much structure to it, but you do see that white circle interior of the crater.

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,534
It does stand out as brighter from the ejecta blanket.

15
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:35,586
Um, it does look like it is the, um, it almost looks like a ejecta, an ejecta ray from Jackson actually goes over it.

16
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:40,649
Um, and it looks very much like a, um, it just passes right through.

17
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,414
So I think that it is underneath one of those rays that is coming down from Jackson crater.

18
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:46,474
Um,

19
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:59,399
It's really neat to see all these bright spots with all these rays right now in this lighting and really excited to move on to our next target.
