1
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:03,705
Alright, moving on to target number 15.

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:04,827
We're going to Jackson.

3
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:07,290
So I'm looking at Jackson now.

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:16,262
I've certainly been able to locate it given some of the surrounding landmarks to focus in on it.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,506
If I do look down at my LTP, I tend to

6
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:25,337
lose exactly where it's at, so it takes some relocating every time I look back out.

7
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:34,565
So I'm gonna concentrate on just describing Jackson and then I'll take a look and make sure I didn't miss anything in the actions or the cue card.

8
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:41,492
So just looking at Jackson for its shape and size, super circular,

9
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:42,778
crater.

10
00:00:43,279 --> 00:01:03,312
I do pick up in this illumination condition some of the central peak that looks at the bottom of Jackson and get a lot of the terracing, particularly to the nine o'clock position in our current orientation of the window with 12 o'clock being up the lunar north.

11
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,535
Now also mention that

12
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,352
I see some distinct rays from Jackson.

13
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:14,153
I think that was one of the actions out of the LTP.

14
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:27,781
I see distinct rays at the four o'clock and the 10 o'clock that extend about five to six Jackson diameters away from Jackson itself.

15
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:44,162
And those kind of peter out or I lose that distinct ray colorization when it impacts or when it gets into some other impacts that are further extent, but also have some, some rays associated with them.

16
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:51,947
But Jackson for sure is, has some distinct rays as my eyes have become adapted to the lighting environment.

17
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:57,477
There also maybe is a subtle ray that goes down to the seven o'clock.

18
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:05,980
It's less prominent, but definitely see some of those light tone rays coming from Jackson.

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,422
Now they're light tone, but they're not in this illumination condition any lighter than the bottom of Jackson.

20
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:20,645
So if I was to describe the three color tones that I just outlined there, the lightest is the

21
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:30,297
the bottom of Jackson and then the light rays are the next color tone and then there's kind of the gray background that is the surrounding terrain.

22
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:38,247
And so I just wanted to enumerate that tonal difference in three distinct broad categories.

23
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:42,866
Um, let me take a look at the LTP again here real quick.

24
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:49,949
So that covers the color, some of those albedos, um, and that tonal difference that I was talking about and texture.

25
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:57,691
Yeah, the biggest texture thing that sticks out with Jackson to me, um, is the terracing and that central peak.

26
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:05,614
Um, don't see any specific texture in those rays I described, but the terracing is pretty, um,

27
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,873
dramatic, even though it's a small crater, it stands out because of that terracing.

28
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,795
And I think that covers it for the LTP.

29
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,336
Let me take one last look.

30
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:32,283
Yeah, the relationship with the rays across the surface are, as I described, pretty prominent within two or three crater diameters of Jackson and then start to fall off as you get to those five or six crater diameters away.

31
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:34,424
That's it with Jackson.

32
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,265
Moving on to the next one.
