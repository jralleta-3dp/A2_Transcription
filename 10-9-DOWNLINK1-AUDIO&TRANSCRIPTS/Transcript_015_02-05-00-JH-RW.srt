1
00:00:02,082 --> 00:00:02,902
Alright, this is Maria.

2
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:13,989
I'm gonna again talk through the Terminator because I did it once already but completely missed it the last time so I guess I'll just take a new mosaic.

3
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,310
So I'm gonna just take a higher resolution one.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,454
I did just finish a mosaic before but I will do another one because I want to talk through the recording.

5
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,837
So, I am snaking my way up.

6
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:31,339
Oh, there's Mare Injunai.

7
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,680
I can really see that in the swirls there.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,282
I'm working my way up from there, and then I'm going to snake over closer to the Terminator.

9
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:44,625
Right now, the Terminator is not in my view, but I'll get over there.

10
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:53,469
It's really interesting to see the depressions, the difference in the amount of depression that you see in these critters.

11
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,187
as I work my way up here.

12
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,109
I'm up near the North Pole now.

13
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,551
I'm gonna snake over a little bit more to the left.

14
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:07,157
Sounds like they're working on the toilet behind me, but glad they can get that checked out.

15
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:09,820
Now I'm up in Muscoviense.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,461
I'm working my way back down.

17
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:15,525
There's that little tiny mare-filled crater not too far below it.

18
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:18,568
Now I'm working my way back down.

19
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:27,720
Making sure that I have- oh, now I'm back at Jules Verne with those scarps.

20
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,202
Back over to the left.

21
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,304
And now I have the Terminator in view.

22
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:33,665
There I am at that.

23
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:56,411
make sure that I get and now the moon is the earth is back in that view also absolutely incredible view here
