00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:07,996
Jeremy here doing my next observation, which is Target 24, South Polacan Basin.

2
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:29,804
Reid has the camera right now, so I'm just using my eyes, looking at this pretty big region, which is most of the south, you know, south side of the moon, except what's kind of cut off by the Terminator on my west.

3
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:32,723
The first thing I'll note is the color.

4
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:44,251
The thing that stands out the most with the color is the light-toned ray that's coming straight kind of through the margin of Apollo Basin and Oppenheimer.

5
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,612
It continues all the way down.

6
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:49,755
I can't necessarily say I see the end of it.

7
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,097
This keeps continuing down through the moon.

8
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:08,861
Maybe it kind of goes, it follows a linear trajectory and then maybe has one fork in it that's forking towards the west.

9
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,222
But that light tone is pretty clear.

10
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,903
The dark mare patches are also, in contrast, stand out.

11
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:33,355
Apollo Basin, dark blue mare, and then that's a similar kind of tone in mare to maybe a little bit of Leibniz crater.

12
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:45,263
And then looking more towards the Terminator, maybe a little bit also in some of the swirls of Injani have a little bit of that dark blue as well.

13
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:51,071
and then things are a little bit more lost from color towards the terminator.

14
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,232
And then color-wise, again, the redder tones in Apollo Basin are standing out.

15
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:07,535
And then also there's some like reddish tones in Mare Anjanai too.

16
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:12,477
It's got that right above the margin on the north side.

17
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,919
It almost seems like a little bit of like a red

18
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:28,045
I don't want to say glow, but a little bit of a diffuse red color that emanates out from the north of Injani, which is really pretty spectacular.

19
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:32,008
And it's a little bit in the swirls as well, that red tone.

20
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,491
Reddish, orangish, muted colors.

21
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,212
Not very bright, but muted.

22
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,755
In terms of structures, I can roughly see the

23
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:51,698
You're going to call the boundary of South Pohegan Basin at the at the northern side.

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,029
And then some of these right at the terminator that roughness pops out.

25
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:03,495
I'm not entirely sure what crater.

26
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:12,074
Sorry, what ridges is standing out to me right at that terminator, but it's to the east of engine.

27
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:19,082
I definitely looks like it's more, uh, an elongated ridge and that's, that's pretty clear.

28
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:20,564
Um, it's really cool.

29
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:24,088
All that lighting makes that topography stand out.
