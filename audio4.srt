1
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:06,953
Okay, next up is Leibniz Target.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,014
Kelsey's got the camera.

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:14,297
I'm now in the port starboard window making observations, trying to get oriented.

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,279
The target name is Leibniz Crater.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,381
Trying to get oriented.

6
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:28,326
It's a little bit skewed to us now, so doing some magic here with the tablet to get oriented.

7
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:35,427
oblique to us and got a pretty good view at it.

8
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:40,071
And I think the target is to try to get a good zoom on this one, Kelsey.

9
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,613
It's a really circular crater.

10
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:50,181
If I'm looking at the right one with Leibniz, it's got a rubbly texture that surrounds the interior of the crater.

11
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,762
It's got really two unique craters inside of it.

12
00:00:54,223 --> 00:01:10,970
One is, I can see the depression given this illumination, the other one looks like it's infilled a little bit, looks like two eyes if I turn my head the right way, and then the the face of the crater or the nose of the crater would, there is a some distinctive color change

13
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:18,953
I think this may be something that I was cuing my eyes into earlier with these lunar swirls and a little bit of color change.

14
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,515
It's definitely brighter in that area.

15
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,717
Again, struggling with the orientation, but I believe

16
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:35,163
I believe Oppenheimer and Apollo Basin were just to the north of this now or just upwards of this.

17
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:38,685
I don't know if I've got my orientation right, but I could be a little screwed up on this one.

18
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:43,228
Hopefully the camera will capture its orientation with the surrounding craters.

19
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:58,715
Shadows are coming from the bottom up now and making the six o'clock of our view right now very distinctive, that rubbly texture I described at the more southern or the six o'clock position of the crater.

20
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:12,668
and the 12 o'clock position of the crater from our orientation definitely has a disturbed rim as a medium-sized crater has definitely disturbed that rim and made some unique features in there.

21
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:23,217
Slopes look pretty crazy in that rubbly area and the textures are just pretty flat across the middle of that crater, just

22
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:30,658
wanted to definitely highlight and hopefully the camera captures that unique colorization that we're seeing in some of that possible lunar swirls.

23
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,520
Um, it's a tonal difference, definitely makes it stand out.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Um, and the, the swirl part is a little bit lighter toned.

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:50,183
Uh, I would say medium gray leading up to that a little bit brighter white to tan, um, lunar swirl area in the center of the crater as described.

26
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:50,923
Okay.

27
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:51,843
Onto the next target.
