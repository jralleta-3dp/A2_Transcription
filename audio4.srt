1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,971
Alright, let's do a video.

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:15,306
We are doing video D and looking for target D. A cratering target, so this is what I'm looking at on my computer with my eyeballs.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:25,465
this video starting out with the sun's corona and the sun rising over the western limb.

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,026
it's so pretty.

5
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:28,447
oh my goodness.

6
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:30,588
they're gonna love this.

7
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:37,553
and so i'm waiting for the sun's light to start illuminating the lunar surface.

8
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:45,538
the light of the sun is changing from it's very bright white in the center go on sort of yellowy

9
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:49,091
and then transitioning out to a light blue and a darker blue.

10
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:54,675
And as the sun starts to leave our view, the moon's starting to become illuminated.

11
00:00:54,715 --> 00:01:00,120
It's very high contrast, and we're seeing a Western limb of the moon.

12
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:07,226
And so what we can see is near the equatorial region, I believe, of the lunar surface.

13
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:10,188
The target's becoming in view now.

14
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:13,351
The very high contrast of this crater, very

15
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:27,450
high topography, very textured surface, but the interiors of the craters are very dark and the surface you can see is puckered with smaller craters in the texture there.

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,810
So our target is coming to view.

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,070
It's a circular crater.

18
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:34,432
I don't see any interior structure to it, so probably a simple crater.

19
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:40,154
It has a slightly raised rim and it sort of seems like a

20
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,349
a shallower part going into it there.

21
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:57,059
On the right hand side, the raised rim is getting the light of the sun shining off it.

22
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:05,105
We can see some terrace features inside the rim of the crater.

23
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:10,649
There are some smaller three craters smaller to the west of the

24
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:16,048
of our target and one more to like the six o'clock region below.

25
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,952
And then we've got, gosh, this is a mess trying to describe as it went by.

26
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:27,715
And I lost my thing.

27
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:36,499
So the tone of the surface is a brighter, lighter gray and then very dark into the interiors of the craters.

28
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,461
We have the, I did the texture already.

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,664
topography you can actually see that there are some raised structures and the decline into the craters.

30
00:02:48,085 --> 00:03:01,412
you can see the beginning of a complex crater around the seven eight o'clock zone so you can tell that there is a central peak inside of that crater.

31
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:08,336
you don't see a lot of like streaks or halos around these craters.

32
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:15,367
The crater edges are pretty well defined.

33
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,654
But they are sort of scallopy.

34
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:28,941
And I do not see any infilling in these craters with this lighting here.

35
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:34,047
The slopes...

36
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:44,443
Probably steeper slopes, which is probably just an illusion on the western rim of the target versus the eastern rim.

37
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:56,329
And you can tell that some of the craters to the west, the ones at about 10, 9, and 8, they are overlapping each other.

38
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,770
So you can see those geologic relationships.

39
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,833
And you do see some smaller craters imprinted on our target crater.

40
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:09,080
um that was a bit of a mess.

41
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:20,217
but that's gonna be harder to do when we are... yeah we should think about watching movies a lot harder than just looking at one picture.

42
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:26,347
so but it's beautiful seeing the corona and watching the sun come up at the beginning.

43
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,491
um we'll end it there.

44
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,115
sorry that was a mess, have fun!
